The team behind 0x strongly believes that in the future, you will find thousands of tokens from Ethereum and that 0x can provide an efficient and trustworthy way to exchange them.\r\n\r\n0x have several benefits such as it can be any asset. The 0x protocol facilitates the exchange of a growing number of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?asset_platform_id=279&view=market\">Ethereum-based tokens</a> including currencies, game items, and many more digital assets. Besides, it has a networked liquidity. By sharing a standard API, relayers can easily aggregate liquidity pools, creating network effects around liquidity that compound as more relayers come online. 0x also can be exchanged anywhere. 0x allows trade functionality to fade into the background, enabling developers to focus on building while 0x handles the exchange.\r\n\r\nThe co-founders of 0x are Will Warren and Amir Bandeali, the first of which is the CEO and the second of which is the CTO. Both are in smart contract research and development. Warren used to conduct applied physics research at the Los Alamos National Laboratory after studying mechanical engineering at UC San Diego. Bandeali used to be a fixed income trader with DRW after he studied finance at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. \r\n\r\n0x doesn’t charge fees of any type to use their protocol; it is free. However, if someone chooses to create a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange using the protocol, that person, known as a Relayer, can charge fees.\r\n\r\nHow does it work?\r\n\r\n0x protocol works where : A “Creator” sends his request and at that same point the request is posted in an off-chain arrange/order book by the “Relayer”, next to which the request is acknowledged by the “Taker” by pushing the exchange into the task’s DEX smart contract. Thus, the 0x protocol uses off-chain order books, which is maintained by a relayer for settlement of trade between two parties. Relayers, being behind the maintenance and creation of these channels are incentivised by charging and collecting fees.\r\n\r\n0x (ZRX) Token:\r\n\r\nZRX token is the unique aspect of 0x project which will be used to pay ‘relayers the trading fees by the users of the protocol. It is also a governance token in a decentralized form for the 0x protocol’s upgrade. ","0xcert":"0xcert is an open source, a permission-less protocol for certified non-fungible tokens on the blockchain. These tokens are stored in cryptographic wallets and are owned by users. In addition to common functions for managing and transferring standard non-fungible tokens, the 0xcert protocol provides conventions for creating certified non-fungible tokens from unique digital assets. These tokens are called Xcerts and are created through a custom minting process. Xcerts represent standard non-fungible tokens, which also hold information about a real-world digital asset. With 0xcert protocol, we can validate a proof of existence, authenticity, and ownership of these digital assets without third-party involvement.\r\n\r\nThe protocol also uses fungible tokens known as ZXC as utility tokens in the system and comply with the ERC20 standard on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> blockchain. The tokens are used to support decentralized applications that are built on top of the protocol. The role of the token is to be a mechanism used as an incentive and to support the entire ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThe flexible nature of the 0xcert protocol infrastructure ensures that interoperability is achieved among decentralized applications. The protocol is flexible enough to support a variety of business models.The availability of the protocol's pluggable framework allows for the reduction of the time used during the building of decentralized applications.The protocol contains a registry of issuers that have been verified on the network, which allows for the authentication of issuers as well as knowing their validity. A common registry reduces the time taken for verification and reduces business risk.","Bitcoin Volatility Token":"Bitcoin Volatility Token (BVOL) is an ERC20 token which attempts to track 1 times the implied volatility of Bitcoin","Aave":"","Aave BAT":"Aave BAT is an interest bearing token minted upon deposit and burned when redeemed.

What is ABCC Token?\r\n\r\nABCC Token (AT) is an ERC20 Token to be issued by ABCC Digital Asset Exchange. The total supply of AT is fixed at 210 million without any future offering.\r\n\r\n2. Benefits of AT\r\n\r\nAT is a blockchain-based token native to ABCC Digital Asset Exchange. Members holding AT will be able to get access to a wide range of benefits including but not limited to—\r\n\r\nUsing AT for various products and services on ABCC. For example, members can purchase other digital assets, pay transaction fees and gain preferential access to premium services with AT. \r\nParticipating in various activities and campaigns on ABCC. ABCC will reward members who meet certain criteria. For example, members holding AT will share in 80% of trading commissions collected by ABCC.\r\nParticipating in various activities such as community building, interaction between members and ABCC, proposing suggestions to ABCC and others. \r\n3. Initial Allocation\r\n\r\nBelow is a breakdown of the initial allocation of AT.\r\n\r\n4. Issuance\r\n\r\nWe will adopt a mechanism called “Trade Contribution + Simultaneous Release” to issue AT.\r\n\r\n4.1 Trade Contribution\r\n\r\nIn order to encourage our users to trade on ABCC, we have decided to reward our members with 50% of the total supply of AT. \r\n\r\nOf the 50% rewarded to users, 4/5 (i.e. 40% of the total supply) will be used to reward members who trade on our exchange platform via the “Trade-to-Mine” (ToM) mechanism. The other 1/5 (i.e. 10% of the total supply) will be granted to users who traded prior to the issuance of AT.\r\n\r\n4.1.1 Trade-to-Mine (ToM)\r\n\r\n40% of the total supply of AT will be used to reward members who trade on our exchange platform via the “Trade-to-Mine” (ToM) mechanism.\r\n\r\nDrawing inspirations from the Bitcoin mining model, we have adopted a similar inflation model for AT.  In particular, the ToM mechanism includes two steps, i.e., “release” and “distribution”. \r\n\r\nRelease\r\n\r\nThe release of AT follows a half-life decay pattern. There are 6 half-life periods in total with each period being 120 days (roughly 4 months). We will release half of the total supply of AT in the first 120 days. The number of AT to be released in the following half-life period will be halved, and so on. Please see details of AT release schedule below. \r\n\r\nWithin each half-life period, one “block” will be generated every 6 hours. The same number of AT will be released for every block inside the same half-life period. For example, the number of AT to be released for one block in the 1st half-life period is calculated as follows.\r\n\r\nThe total number of AT in the 1st half-life period: 42,000,000;\r\nThe number of days in the 1st half-life period: 120 days;\r\nOne block will be generated every 6 hours;\r\nThe number of blocks to be generated every day: 24 hours / 6 hours = 4;\r\nTherefore, the number of AT to be released for one block in the 1st half-life period: 42,000,000/120 / (24 hours / 6 hours) = 87,500.\r\nDistribution\r\n\r\nWe will distribute AT released in a block to members per the percentage of their trading fees within that block.\r\n\r\nIf it so happens that there are no members eligible for the rewards in a certain block, the released AT assigned to this block will be distributed in the next block.\r\n\r\n4.1.2 Reward for Historical Trades\r\n\r\n10% of the total supply of AT will be used to reward eligible existing users.  We will distribute the rewards to the eligible users based on their cumulative trade volume contribution ending 24:00 June 27th, 2018 (UTC+8). The rewards will be frozen for 180 days after the launch of AT.\r\n\r\n4.2 Simultaneous Release\r\n\r\nAT will be released to the platform, team and investors in proportion to the number of AT released and distributed to members via Trade-to-Mine (ToM).\r\n\r\nThe number of AT released via Simultaneous Release = the number of AT released and distributed via ToM * (50% / 40%).","Aced":"AceD coin is a privacy oriented platform.

Shortly, DPoS suggests that all coin holders vote for the validator nodes that will produce the next blocks.\r\n\r\nOn the project website, only info about CEO Tony Cui is listed. Cui has a few significant accomplishments, including winning the Future Star award from the Zhongguancun Alliance and being listed in the 30 under 30 on CYZONE, a famous venture capital magazine. On LinkedIn, 51 people are listed as employees at Achain. Most of the team is based in Beijing. Achain also has a few key industry partners. It has even co-organized a “Blockchain Technology Open Course” with Tsinghua University, which is widely recognized as one of the world’s top universities.\r\n\r\nThe roadmap for Achain development is fairly detailed. However, most goals listed are development-oriented rather than marketing or design. Still, it’s important to note that focusing on making the protocol interoperable and building a technology that is more accessible to mainstream adoption could also be considered a marketing-oriented part of this project. There are three major phases with projected completion dates listed. These include Singularity (completed Q1), Galaxy (ongoing), and Cosmos (complete at the end of Q4). One thing to note is that dates for these phases are not consistent between the homepage and the whitepaper. This could be simply due to a scenario in which phase names remain the same while new goals and timeline dates within those phases continue to change. In January 2019, the project will update the website to reflect roadmap goals for the new year.\r\n\r\nLooking at the current landscape of blockchain projects, Achain certainly offers the possibility of much-needed technical innovations. The ability to easily create an Achain fork, as well as, the protocol’s unique RDPoS consensus algorithm make this a promising project. It will be interesting to see how Achain builds upon its accomplishments, and how the project team continues to develop a long-term strategy for improving the protocol’s technical capabilities and increasing participation in its ecosystem.","ACoconut":"acBTC is a composite asset backed by a basket of ERC20 BTC.

It was launched with the aim of becoming the ‘official’ cryptocurrency of Iceland. AUR was a pioneer in the area of country-specific cryptocurrencies. AUR was launched on the 25th of January, 2014, by an anonymous developer who went by the pseudonym of Baldur Friggjar Óðinsson. It was originally based on <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/litecoin\">Litecoin</a>, using the Scrypt algorithm with a Proof of Work mechanism, but was later updated to use a multi-algorithm architecture in 2016, forked from <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/digibyte\">DigiByte</a>.\r\n\r\nAuroracoin uses the PoW consensus mechanism, which utilises device hashing power to solve a complex mathematical problem in order to authenticate a transaction proposed to be stored in the blockchain. The difficulty of solving the problem ensures that authenticating forged transactions is very difficult unless the attacker owns an impractically large chunk of the network’s total hashing power. AUR is one of the only cryptocurrencies to use a combination of five different hashing algorithms, namely Grøstl, Qubit, scrypt, SHA-256, and Skein.\r\n\r\nWhile initially very popular, Auroracoin has seen little to no activity for a while, with poor marketing, and frequent dev team changes. Reasons for little growth have been various, from slow adoption in Iceland, to developers leaving and joining the project midway. However, it is expected to not go lower than the recent low, and might see a rise as AUR plans to launch a more aggressive marketing campaign in Iceland to promote the coin among the masses. Unlike most other altcoins, Auroracoin has made extensive changes to the original codebase. It has introduced security measures such as Automatic checkpointing, and protecting against known flaws present in the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">BTC</a> blockchain, such as 51% block replacement attacks.","IDEX":"","AurumCoin":"AurumCoin – The first virtual coin backed up in solid gold.

That is exactly what happened with our project – Balkan coin. We are a group of developers, marketing workers and web developers from the Balkans, which were dedicated to this idea several years ago, but the final realization came at the end of 2017, which on the other hand proved to be a boom year for all other crypto currencies, especially for the Bitcoin, ethereum monero etc.\r\n\r\nIn the background of this idea, the need of a sophisticated way to connect all people who originate from this part of the world – the Balkan Peninsula, was dragged as a thread. As most people know, the Balkans is a region which is located in the southeastern part of Europe and which in the past was the center of world’s greatest interests, starting with the Crusades, the Balkan Wars, World War I and World War II. The oldest crossroads in the mankind history pass through the Balkan, it is the cradle of the oldest civilizations, and of course, there are many great names that origin from this peninsula, such as Alexander the Great and Nikola Tesla. As a geographical area with such turbulent and significant history, the Balkan has left a trace in the genes of all people who originate from this part of the world.\r\n\r\nThe Balkan man is probably a combination of the most controversial features of every person (hospitality, cordiality, friendliness, hard work, but also selfishness, belligerence, enraged, vulgarity, low self-esteem etc.). The countries that gravitate in this region are almost without exception led by incompetent people whose only goal in life is to get rich on the back of the citizens, disregarding the basic human freedom and the right of each individual, and that is perhaps the karma of this region remaining from the past.\r\n\r\nA man who originates from the Balkan, who possesses these features, can easily adapt to any living conditions in different geographical areas. Therefore, the number of people of this part of the world who are looking for better future is huge, so they quite often decide to leave their homes and seek their existence in other more prosperous countries.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Balkan man is emotionally attached and committed to his family. He always tries to find a way to help his loved ones who still live in the countries of this region. Tens of billions of dollars are sent each year from “our” people from the more economically developed countries to their close relatives and friends. They have a significant role in reducing the deficit in the economy in almost all Balkan countries through foreign exchange remittance. For example, in Macedonia only, these remittances are approximately 1 billion dollars. All the transactions are carried out through banks or through fast money transfer services. Both of them are quite slow and burdened by large commissions that end up in the bank accounts.\r\n\r\nHaving this in mind, our idea was born – Balkancoin. Every person from any place on the globe, even broader if it has internet connection, can send a value personified in Balkan coins to any person in the Balkan and anywhere in world (in fact, this is the main goal of the crypto-currency).","BALL Coin":"BALLcoin \r\nSports betting using Crypto ","Balloon Coin":"Balloon Coin, which is used in the social-dating app Hot-Talk, will increase its value through the use of blockchains and AI technology.

The project offers a network, which we’ll discuss soon, that works to bring liquidity to the majority of tokens that lack a consistent supply/demand in exchanges. That network is built on smart contracts and a new class of cryptocurrencies that the team calls “Smart Tokens.” Bancor is looking to provide support to the illiquidity that currently exists within the cryptocurrency market. Illiquidity isn’t so much an issue for top coins like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> or <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> because there are always buyers and sellers looking to exchange those coins. It is definitely an issue, however, for the thousands of other tokens that may serve legitimate decentralized purposes but haven’t attracted enough attention in the market to be liquid.\r\n\r\nBancor’s protocol uses smart contracts to create Smart Tokens, which serve as an alternative mechanism for trading. A key characteristic of the protocol is that it doesn’t call for an exchange of tokens with a second party, as in the case of cryptocurrency exchanges. Rather, it employs Smart Tokens to convert between different ERC-20 tokens internally. These conversions take place through the blockchain’s protocol and completely outside of cryptocurrency exchanges. Smart Tokens process token conversions internally by holding reserves of other ERC20 tokens within their Smart Contract. They can then convert back and forth between those reserves as users request it.\r\n\r\nThe Bancor team consists of a core Foundation Council and their Advisory Board. The Foundation Council includes four individuals based out of Zug, Switzerland. Bernard Lietaer is a Belgian civil engineer, economist, author, and professor. Lietaer specialized in monetary systems and promotes the notion of communities creating their own local currencies. Guy Benartzi serves as co-founder and is recognized for founding the gaming company, Mytopia. Benartzi also co-founded Particle Code, a development studio based in Tel Aviv, Israel. Guido Schmitz-Krummacher is an executive of the Bancor Protocol foundation that’s involved with a variety of commercial entrepreneurial ventures in Switzerland. His involvement in the crypto space includes that of Bancor as well as an executive position in crowdfunding network, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tezos\">Tezos (XTZ)</a>. \r\n\r\nOne of the key elements of the Bancor Network is the automated pricing. This comes from the Smart Tokens’ built-in automated market makers. These automated market makers mean that the tokens’ smart contracts always buy or sell Smart Tokens from or to any user in exchange for any connector token (as well as any token found in the network). The price comes from the Bancor Formula. This formula that is responsible for balancing a Smart Token’s demand and supply while also maintaining the ratio between the token’s total value with the connector token balances. The creator of the Smart Token configures these ratios, known as the connector weight. The creator can adjust them with the goal of decreasing or increasing the liquidity level of the token. The connector weight indicates price sensitivity, or how much sells and buys affect the price movement. Any time the prices no longer syncs with prices listed on external exchanges, the arbitrageurs will quickly balance the gaps.\"","Band Protocol":"","BankCoin BCash":"First decentralized marketing platform that allows merchants and affiliates.

Freelancers will make up a whopping 58% of the US workforce by 2027. Consequently, peer-to-peer booking platforms like AirBnB and Uber have seen a meteoric rise in demand accompanying these shifts in the job market. As the definition of work changes and evolves, the difficulties encountered by freelancers and part-time workers such as the lack of protection, and the insecurity of self-employment will only worsen. This not only affects the growing mass of freelancers, but also ruptures the social contract between workers and governments. \r\n\r\nConsumer protections have also weakened because of the murky legal relationship between freelancers and their host platforms. This simmering dissatisfaction has created popular backlash, as concerned governments in several countries such as France have begun to crack down on platforms like Uber and AirBnB. Despite these worrying trends, no workable remedy has been proposed - until now.

There’s a blockchain for everything - from cloud storage <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/siacoin\">(Siacoin)</a> to identity verification <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/civic\">(Civic)</a>. But the original point of Bitcoin, the very cryptocurrency was to overturn the traditional banking system. An interestingly named token - Bread, is here to bring us back on track for this original goal. Bread technology intends to reinvent and revolutionize banking as we know it. By building a blockchain synced, Bitcoin-based wallet, the idea here is to decentralise banking and make it accessible to everyone.\r\n\r\nWith a blockchain connected, easy to use Bitcoin wallet, Bread makes it easy for you to transition to a truly decentralised banking service.It also provides portfolio management tools to offer a comprehensive banking experience. Purchases made using its BRD token attract loyalty points and rewards, giving customers another lucrative reason to use the Bread wallet app.\r\n\r\nBread was officially launched in 2014 itself and even raised VC funding to the tune of $7 million in August 2017. It then went the ICO route in December 2017, where it made available 88 million BRD tokens. $32 million was raised in the price, with BRD being valued at the rate of 900 for every 1 ETH at the time. As of June 2018, just over 6 months later, its value had fallen to above 1600 for every 1 ETH.\r\n\r\nA decentralised banking system was <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin’s</a> original vision that is either taking too long to fruition, or we’ve become an impatient audience. Whatever the case, Bread wants to accelerate the transition. A significant decision the Bread team took was to introduce the BRD token - which, with its cheap rates and loyalty/discount offerings, may emerge as the primary incentive for users joining the platform. If this is indeed the case, expect a spike in the value of the BRD cryptocurrency, something investors right now would be eyeing closely. Having said that, its fall in value since the ICO is certainly a cause for concern, and investors are advised to do their research and analyse before taking decisions.","Breezecoin":"Breeze Coin is a cryptocurrency that will be used within the Breeze de Mar project.

And when the guests arrive, the amount of resources can only accommodate so many people, the portions are small and then everything eventually runs out and the party ends. Think Constellation DAG like a potluck (a party where everyone brings food/drinks). With every added guest (node to the network), the more resources the party has to keep going. This is the nature of Constellation, a distributed system that scales horizontally.\r\n\r\nIs Constellation a Blockchain?\r\nNot exactly. Although inspired by the principles of decentralization, many standard blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum face scalability issues. This is why the next, generation of decentralized networks such as Hashgraph, IOTA, and Constellation have turned to DAG.\r\n\r\nWhat is a Microservice?\r\n“Microservices” is an approach to application development in which a large application is built as a suite of modular services.

The spread of the virus will be documented on the blockchain. A portion of token sales will go to fund Red Cross relief efforts.","Cortex":"Cortex is built on a new public chain called Cortex. The chain includes AI algorithms that support smart contracts, which means anyone can use Cortex to add AI to their smart contracts. It also creates an incentive mechanism for collective collaboration, allowing anyone to submit and optimize models in Cortex, while model contributors can also be rewarded. The end result of Cortex, according to the whitepaper, is the creation of “artificial general intelligence”, or AGI, “being born on the Cortex”. Cortex completed a private token sale in February/March 2018 for its CTXC tokens. That funding round was led by Bitmain and FBG Capital, among other well-known investors in the cryptocurrency space.\r\n\r\nPlacing artificial intelligence systems on the blockchain isn’t a straightforward process. However, Cortex will solve this problem by allowing machine learning researchers around the world to upload well-trained corresponding data models to the storage layer of the Cortex public chain. Other users who need these AI models can make inferences using the models, then pay the person who developed those models. At each inference, a full node synchronizes the model and the data from the storage tier to the local site. Making an inference using Cortex’s unique virtual machine, or CVM, will synchronize the results to the whole network and then return the result. Every time a user initiates a transaction on the Cortex, opens a smart contract, or performs an intelligence inference, the user will need to pay a certain number of “Endorphin” tokens.\r\n\r\nEndorphin is the pricing unit for transactions on Cortex. However, the platform will have two tokens, including Endorphins and Cortex Coins (CTXC). The overall goal of Cortex is to provide state-of-the-art machine learning models on the blockchain where users can infer using smart contracts. Cortex also seeks to create a machine learning platform where users can post tasks on the platform or submit artificial intelligence-based decentralized apps.\r\n\r\nCortex’s token sale began with a single private placement round. That round took place from February 7 to March 7, 2018, during which tokens were sold at a price of 1 ETH = 1500 CTXC. In March 2018, the company announced that it had reached its target cap of 40,000 ETH for 60 million CTXC, or 20.01% of the total token distribution. FBG Capital and Bitmain were lead investors during the token sale. CTXC tokens are ERC20 tokens on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> blockchain. There’s a total supply of 299,792,458 tokens. Of the total supply, 50.03% (150 million) are reserved for Cortex coin miners as a mining reward, 24.95% (74,792,458) are dedicated to the project’s foundation from the genesis block (including 15.01% to the Cortex Lab, 9.01% to project marketing, and 0.93% to challenge bounties), with the remaining 5% going to advisors, academia, and the community from the genesis block.\r\nCortex aims to place advanced artificial intelligence systems on the blockchain. The company recently completed a private investment round during its token sale for CTXC tokens in February/March 2018. The next step is to roll out the Cortex public chain. Key features of the platform include its smart AI contracts and its Cortex Virtual Machine, both of which allow for advanced AI-based smart contract programming.","Cosmo Coin":"Cosmochain is a complementary Company-to-Consumer platform that connects cosmetics product users and content creators to cosmetics product suppliers, including cosmetics companies, OEM/ODM manufacturers, R&D centers, and distributors. Through this platform, the Cosmochain Team aims to solve the aforementioned unmet needs of both companies and customers. All data collected from platform participants are kept confidential in this customer-centered ecosystem. Those who contribute their scarce time and attention toward producing and curating contents for others are compensated with tokens and receive pro-rata ownership of the contents they create. On the other hand, cosmetics product suppliers are able to actualize a wide variety of “on-demand” services on the platform by utilizing API that Cosmochain provides. \r\n\r\nTwo different tokens and one internal virtual index make up the Cosmochain ecosystem: 1) The first token is an externally traded token called Cosmo Coin, 2) The second token as well as an index of contribution to the platform is Cosmo Power, which can be used to make payment within the platform and given out as rewards for activities, and 3) The one virtual index is called Cosmo Level. Cosmo Level, a reputation index, is designed to prevent abuse of power within the platform and can only be accumulated by actual activities and contribution. Having been assigned distinct roles within the Cosmochain platform, these three entities construct a healthy ecosystem.\r\n\r\n● The success of the Cosmochain platform lies in the active participation of users – where customers create reliable data after trying out various cosmetics products and sharing the experience with one another on the platform. As a result, Cosmochain has designed its own transparent and fair reward system based on Steemit’s incentive model.\r\n\r\n● The Cosmochain platform connects this user-created data to interested company participants and distributes the payment made by the company to customers as reward for use of the information. Through this reward system, Cosmochain aims to address two structural issues of social media-based platforms: 1) risk of inflation following the necessity of a long-term and great quantity of token issuance to grow the community, and 2) risk of decreasing attractiveness of contribution rewards after the inflation rate has been stabilized. \r\n\r\n● In addition, the Cosmochain platform aims to realize an upgraded tokenization model that brings the power back to its users by redistributing the following: (i) the right to display ads in a user’s viewing space, (ii) the right to access a personally curated Marketplace, and (iii) the right to share personal data to partake in a study or survey. Simply speaking, the Cosmochain platform will go beyond simply allowing users to share onedimensional personal information. \r\n\r\nAs such, Cosmochain serves the purpose of revolutionizing the cosmetics industry’s ecosystem by redistributing ownership and management authority of personal cosmetics data and contents to those in need, and through operations of transparent rewarding system for the redistribution of data.","Cosmos":"The Cosmos network consists of many independent, parallel blockchains, called zones, each powered by classical Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols like Tendermint (already used by platforms like ErisDB). Some zones act as hubs with respect to other zones, allowing many zones to interoperate through a shared hub. The architecture is a more general application of the Bitcoin sidechains concept, using classic BFT and Proof-of-Stake algorithms, instead of Proof-of-Work.Cosmos can interoperate with multiple other applications and cryptocurrencies, something other blockchains can’t do well. By creating a new zone, you can plug any blockchain system into the Cosmos hub and pass tokens back and forth between those zones, without the need for an intermediary.\r\n\r\nWhile the Cosmos Hub is a multi-asset distributed ledger, there is a special native token called the atom. Atoms have three use cases: as a spam-prevention mechanism, as staking tokens, and as a voting mechanism in governance.\r\n\r\nAs a spam prevention mechanism, Atoms are used to pay fees. The fee may be proportional to the amount of computation required by the transaction, similar to Ethereum’s concept of “gas”. Fee distribution is done in-protocol and a protocol specification is described here.\r\n\r\nAs staking tokens, Atoms can be “bonded” in order to earn block rewards. The economic security of the Cosmos Hub is a function of the amount of Atoms staked. The more Atoms that are collateralized, the more “skin” there is at stake and the higher the cost of attacking the network. Thus, the more Atoms there are bonded, the greater the economic security of the network.\r\n\r\nAtom holders may govern the Cosmos Hub by voting on proposals with their staked Atoms.","Cosplay Token":"Cure WorldCosplay is the world’s largest Cosplay platform, supporting 12 languages, more than 720,000 members from 180 countries and 6.5 million (and counting!) images.

","Counterparty":"Counterparty is a platform for user-created assets on <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a>. It’s a protocol, set of specifications, and an API. Taken together, it allows users to create and trade assets on top of Bitcoin’s blockchain. In this way, Counterparty is similar to platforms like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/waves\">Waves</a> or <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>. Of course, the difference is Counterparty integrates directly with Bitcoin. Therefore, it comes will all the security and reliability (and issues) that are part of the Bitcoin blockchain. This is a fairly old project. In fact, it pre-dates Ethereum with its launch in 2014. It was the original asset creation mechanism. As you’re probably aware, Counterparty has faded from prominence over the years. This is largely due to the rise of the ERC-20 token standard on Ethereum.\r\n\r\nWhile we’ve become used to calling blockchain assets, tokens, it doesn’t necessarily have to be the case. An asset can represent anything that has value or is rare. As a result, Counterparty steers clear of the word “token” in their marketing and documentation. They’re much more interested in digital assets of all kinds, not just currencies, securities, and utility tokens. Digital assets can be a digital marker of a physical object, an easy way to manage shares in your company, or reputation karma for a website. These are all types of assets you could create on Counterparty (or Ethereum or Waves, for that matter). Counterparty creates the set of rules, requirements, integrations, etc that are necessary for assets on the Bitcoin blockchain. It’s the infrastructure behind user-created assets in much the same way that the ERC-20 protocol sets up guidelines and standards for asset creation on Ethereum.\r\n\r\nOne useful function of digital assets is as a marker of ownership or voting rights. Imagine a scenario where you issued a digital asset to each of your company’s board members in proportion to the amount of voting power held. Or if you gave your stockholders a digital asset as a marker of the amount of stock they owned. If you issued your stock asset, you could then use Counterparty’s distribution function to pay out dividends in BTC based on the amount of digital stock asset each person owned.\r\n\r\nCounterparty addresses many of the same issues as Ethereum or Waves, but on the Bitcoin blockchain. While that does come with some advantages, ultimately it is not as strong a platform for development as its competitors. It’s best suited for applications that need to interface with Bitcoin or assets that have a specific connection to the Bitcoin ecosystem.","Coupit":"Coupit is a decentralized incentive platform that utilizes the NEO blockchain,  thereby reducing third party interaction while providing a transparent  operational system.

It is an innovative blockchain that can be used for digital assets, smart contracts, decentralized applications and secure authentication.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat makes DigiByte stronger than others?\r\nDigiByte is a rapidly growing open-source blockchain created in late 2013 and released in early 2014. After 6 years of forward thinking development, DigiByte has become one of the safest, fastest, longest and most decentralized UTXO blockchain in existence.\r\n\r\n\r\nTruly Decentralized.\r\nDigiByte has never been funded through an ICO or significant amount of premined coins. There is no CEO or a company controlling the DigiByte blockchain. It is a volunteer based and global community driven project.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore secure.\r\nDigiByte uses 5 cryptographic algorithms and real time difficulty adjustment to prevent malicious mining centralization and hash power fluctuation. One of which is Odocrypt that changes itself every 10 days for ASIC resistance.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch faster.\r\nDigiByte blocks occur every 15 seconds which is 40x faster than Bitcoin and 10x faster than Litecoin. Early SegWit implementation and blockchain rigidity enable up to 1066 on-chain transactions per second with negligible fees.\r\n\r\n\r\nForward thinking.\r\nOver the past 6 years, DigiByte has repeatedly set itself apart with multiple blockchain firsts, such asDigiShield guard, MultiAlgo mining, SegWit implementation, Odocrypt algorithm, Dandelion++ privacy protocol, DigiAssets and Digi-ID.\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nThis is how the DigiByte blockchain works.\r\nThe three layers are the most innovative parts of the DigiByte blockchain providing the network infrastructure, security and communications to function with cutting edge speed.\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications / DigiAssets.\r\nThe top layer is like an app store with clear real-world uses. All types of digital assets can be created with the DigiAssets protocol on top of the DigiByte blockchain. Decentralized applications (dApps) can be built on top of the DigiByte blockchain. Also smart contracts that leverage the rigidity and security of the DigiByte blockchain can be encoded easily.\r\n\r\n\r\nDigital asset / Public ledger.\r\nThe middle layer provides security and administration. A Digital Byte of data, a representation of larger data or a unit that holds value, and cannot be counterfeited, duplicated or hacked. An immutable public ledger where all transactions of DigiBytes are recorded. DigiByte uses five proof of work algorithms for security. New DigiBytes come from mining only.\r\n\r\n\r\nCore protocol / Global network.\r\nThe bottom layer provides communication and operating procedures. A very low-level way nodes on the DigiByte global network communicate. Thousands of people are running DigiByte software all across the planet. Any server, computer, tablet or mobile phone connected to the DigiByte network becomes a node that helps relay transactions.\r\n\r\n \r\nOpen source / Permissionless.\r\nJust like the DigiByte.io website, the DigiByte blockchain is completely open source and free to use released under the MIT license, which gives you the power to run and modify the software. Transparency allows for independent verification of binaries and their corresponding source code.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA digital currency you would absolutely love.\r\nDigiByte (DGB) is a highly scalable peer-to-peer digital currency that enables industry-leading transaction speeds with negligible fees. DigiByte is the best way for payments.\r\n\r\n\r\nEasy to use.\r\nGetting started to use DigiByte is even easier than sending an SMS. You can send and receive DigiBytes using the devices you already know and love. All you need is installing a DigiByte supported wallet then click scan, scan the QR code and send DigiByte. As easy as 1..2..3.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot an ICO.\r\nDigiByte has never been funded through an ICO or significant amount of premined coins (0% remaining). There is no CEO or a company controlling the DigiByte blockchain. The founder, developers and the community are unpaid volunteers that eliminate the bankrupt risk.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch faster.\r\nDigiByte transactions are confirmed in approx. 15 seconds, which is 40 times faster than Bitcoin and 10 times faster than Litecoin. SegWit enables up to 1066 on-chain transactions per second and negligible fees make DigiByte the ideal currency for daily payments.\r\n\r\n \r\nAlways secure.\r\nDigiByte has been built on the uncrackable technology of the Bitcoin blockchain and implemented various advanced enhancements over it such as DigiShield guard, MultiAlgo mining and the Odocrypt algorithm. Also Dandelion++ privacy protocol helps keep you safe by hiding your IP and physical location. Learn more.\r\n\r\n\r\nMineable.\r\nDigiByte is a 100% Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain that can be mined with five algorithms called Sha256, Scrypt, Skein, Qubit and Odocrypt. MultiAlgo mining contributes to decentralization, security of the network and gives you the freedom to use different kind of hardware's such as an ASIC a FPGA or a GPU. Learn more.\r\n\r\n\r\nManageable units\r\nCompared to 21 million Bitcoin, 21 billion DigiByte (1000:1 ratio to BTC) have been designed to be ready for mass adoption. DigiByte block rewards reduces by 1% every month instead of halving every 4 years. All 21 billion DigiByte will be mined by the year 2035. After 2035 the miners will then rely on transaction fees alone. Learn more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA simplified way to create digital assets.\r\nDigiAssets is a secure, scalable layer on top of the DigiByte blockchain that allows for the decentralized issuance of assets, tokens, smart contracts, digital identity and more.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitless possibilities.\r\nDigiAssets can be used to securely represent anything we find in the physical world. From tangible assets such as real estate or cars, through to scarce digital pieces of art. Signed documents such as deeds and medical bills can be protected.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowing confidently.\r\nDigiAssets as an ecosystem and platform already has interested parties either planning on or currently building platforms in real estate, finance, remittance, identity, point of sale, racing, trade, healthcare, supply chain, government and more.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolid technology.\r\nDigiAssets leverages unique aspects of a truly decentralized blockchain only found within a permissionless blockchain like DigiByte. This allows DigiAssets to be more secure, scalable and decentralized than any other platform in the market.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nAuthentication at its best.\r\nDigi-ID is a security protocol built on DigiByte blockchain technology that empowers users to effortlessly sign-in to websites, applications, and even into the internet of things.\r\n \r\n\r\nEasy authentication.\r\nDigi-ID eliminates the username, password and 2fa requirements for authentication. Because Digi-ID uses public / private key cryptography, there are no passwords or usernames at risk. This method not only protects the consumer, it also protects the services that the consumer uses.\r\n \r\n\r\nFlawless security.\r\nDigi-ID does not store any data about its users on the DigiByte blockchain. This further strengthens the security while also bolstering end-user’s confidence that their data is neither tracked nor at risk by others negligence. There is no external point of failure for an hacker to exploit your platform.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimple and free.\r\nDigi-ID is completely free! There are no fees, subscription services, or maintenance costs. But the cost is its second best feature. Its primary feature is that, in accordance with DigiBytes security prioritization, Digi-ID is a more secure, yet simple method available to log in to websites, apps and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most passionate community ever!\r\nTens of thousands of volunteers from all over the world have contributed to DigiByte in countless ways for years to make it what it is today.

It hopes to achieve this by enabling users to purchase coverage in physical gold, via the ERC-20 Ethereum-based GOLD token.\r\nThe project holds numerous advantages for its users, the gold market, but also for blockchain technology as a whole.\r\nWith this in mind, customers can use the platform to instantly purchase the GOLD token, each coin being equal to one gram of 99.99% FINE gold that is stored in the company’s vaults. As such, the tokens enable users to indirectly use gold to make monetary transactions, or to leverage it as a wealth storage method. This is achieved without requiring users to follow complicated procedures.\r\nThe token is pegged to the value of the gold spot price, thus also acting as a stablecoin. This makes it useful for protecting against market volatility on the cryptocurrency market, while also allowing users to benefit off long-term gold price uptrends.\r\nLiquidity is ensured at all times, granted that independent live audits can be verified to cross-check the number of tokens in circulation, with the amount of vault-stored gold.\r\nThe digitalization of gold is bound to also increase the worldwide appeal of the precious metal, which has been sought for and used by mankind for thousands of years. The cross-implementation between gold and blockchain technology serves as yet another successful use case scenario, showcasing blockchain’s potential in revolutionizing the financial market.\r\nSpeaking of blockchain, its application in the Digital Gold project allows for several innovative features, including, but not limited to: instant, low-cost transactions carried out via the Ethereum blockchain, immutability for all confirmed transactions (no chargeback risk), overall network security and protection from cyber-attacks, smart contract functionality (propping an instant gold purchase for each token bought), market transparency, support for all ERC- 20 wallets, and support for trading the GOLD token on partner exchanges.\r\nThe GOLD token community can utilize the Digital Gold Marketplace to instantly purchase and/or sale the token. As the parent company is also a liquidity supplier, users are free to carry out as many transactions as they wish, with no additional costs apart from the yearly service fee and the general ‘gas’ cost for Ethereum-based transactions.\r\nThe Digital Gold project is not an Initial Coin Offering, as no crowdfunding effort is being carried out. All operations are self-funded, thus any acquisition of the GOLD token results in an instantaneous smart contract-based purchase of physical gold.\r\nThe worldwide interest in the gold market is well-known, whereas the value of gold Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) exceeds the $100 billion threshold. With the GOLD token, the precious metal can now be more than a wealth storage method and investment tool. With the help of blockchain, gold can now act as a payment method for transactions of all types.","Digital Money Bits":"Digital Money Bits (DMB) is a Free Open Source Project derived from Bitcoin, with the goal of providing a long-term, energy efficient, user friendly cryptocurrency","DigitalNote":"\"DigitalNote describes itself as a decentralized Proof-of-Work(bmw512)/Proof-of-Stake(echo512) hybrid blockchain with fast, untraceable transactions and encrypted messaging features.

Digix has two cryptocurrencies, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/digix-gold\">Digix Gold (DGX)</a> and DigixDAO (DGD), each of which serves a key role in the structure.  The company proudly gets 99.99 percent of its gold from LBMA-approved refiners, with zero percent from fractional reserves, delivering confidence. With Digix, investors can take advantage of the stability and value of gold as well as the ease of cryptocurrency. Digix essentially tokenizes gold within Ethereum. It takes advantage of the Distributed Ledger’s immutability, auditability, and transparency, applying all these benefits to the precious physical asset of gold. Additionally, Digix has developed multiple technologies, such as the DGX tokens and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/digixdao-introduces-gold-tokens-ethereum\">introduced a new Proof of Asset protocol</a> (POA).\r\n\r\nA key feature of Digix is its physical gold bullion. By investing, users buy bullion from the LBMA refineries, including the Assay Certificates from refiners like Nadir Bullion, PAMP Suisse, Valcambi, and others. For security, Digix includes third-party auditing from Bureau Veritas. Every quarter, it audits each gold asset within the safehouse vaults. This auditor has been in business since 1828 and is a world leader in certification, inspection, and testing services. With such a long track record, investors should be able to trust Bureau Veritas for their auditing services. Finally, Digix involves recast, which means customers can take their DGX delivery at the partnering custodial vault. \r\n\r\nDigix incorporated in Singapore in December 2014 and the DGD crowdsale took place on March 30th, 2016. It was the first ever crowdsale and major Distributed Autonomous Organization hosted on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> network. The sale intended to run for 30 days but met its 5.5 million dollars hard cap in just 12 hours, selling 1.7 million DGD tokens and reserving 300,000 for the Digix team. Pledges who sent over 15,000 USD worth of Ether received a special badge which will allow them to submit proposals to the DigixDAO. For better or worse, when you see the word DAO, you might think of hacking. In July 2017, over 4000 DGD were indeed stolen due to a vulnerability in the crowdsale smart contract. The bug was eventually fixed and the tokens reimbursed to the 35 affected addresses.\r\n\r\nIn January 2018, the vast majority of the cryptocurrency market crashed. DGD was the only coin in the top 100 to rise in value in that time. Perhaps this is an early indicator that people will seek gold as a safe haven during times of market uncertainty. The ICO price of DGD was about 3 dollars, but in 2018, DGD reached an all-time high of over 400 dollars. When Digix finally delivers the DGX tokens and the rewards to DGD participants start rolling in, we might see an even higher demand for DigixDAO. When DGX goes live, it will be available for purchase with Ether on the Digix marketplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Digix Gold":"DIGIX DAO TOKENS.

These districts are built upon a decentralized and distributed open-source framework, the d0xINFRA network, which is powered by Ethereum smart contracts. The district0x network aims at creating a friction-free, virtual economy where the users will be able to make buying and selling decisions, complete transactions, and even rank their peers with just one simple click. District0x aims to develop a flexible, and free market with advanced entrepreneurial concepts.\r\n\r\nThe District0x infrastructure has a very neat concept with some well-outlined features, such as the staking interface. A staking interface is put in place that allows DNT holders to have open control over the districts through an Aragon governance layer for all markets that come online. Post creation of a district, an Aragon entity will also be created that people can use to interact with this staking mechanism. After staking a user will receive voting rights in that district.  Using the creation interface, one can remove central power structures from any marketplace without the additional need for development or programming skills. It can be described as the WordPress of dApps where the districts being launched are like wordpress templates and the auxiliary modules are WordPress plugins for extended functionality.\r\n\r\nWhile it is very difficult to buy lesser known cryptocurrencies using fiat currencies (dollars, euros) directly from crypto-exchanges, district0x or DNT can be easily purchased from various exchanges using <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> or <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> as the base cryptocoin. <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/binance\">Binance</a> is one of the popular exchange platforms that can help trade Bitcoin or Ethereum for District0x. One can use various wallets like myetherwallet.com to store the district0x (DNT) coins. Coinbase, Blockchain, Exodus, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/trezor-model-t-wallet-review?locale=en\">Trezor Hardware Wallet</a> are also wallets that supports district0x.\r\n\r\nDistrict0x, differs from most coins in its underlying concept and the architecture it is built on. The concept of interconnected districts and marketplaces promises a novel structure to the modern economies. What a lot of users are missing out on is the fact that it is a staking mechanism and not just a voting token. Staking is basically the process of mining the PoS (proof of stake) coins. Early investors will be able to lock their tokens to a specific district on the network, thus being able to participate in its governance later. DNT tokens can be staked in districts, thus they not only give voting power and privileges within that district but also provide district-specific tokens depending on when the investor had started trading. For example, early investors of the PoS token will be able to make decisions about the distribution of profits among stakeholders, the intricacies of the business model etc. DNT can basically be considered as a dynamic stock in the future district0x ecosystem.\r\n\r\nBy joining the district0x, the user receives district0x coins. They allow the owner to exercise the right to vote for district proposals and make decisions within certain districts. This includes, for example, voting on proposals concerning the future of a particular district or setting fees. The scope of shareholders’ rights is outlined in the bylaws and varies according to the specific scope and purpose of each district. District0x platform users can interact with the functions and services provided by each district. Users can also freely create their own districts. For example, on Ethlance, the first district in the District0x network, users can post job offers or search for new jobs.","DistX":"","Divert Finance":"You can with DEVE Token\r\n-Buy mining contracts:\r\nYou can buy mining contracts and get coins after deducting Divert's owed service fee.\r\n-Buy mining hardware:\r\ncan purchase mining hardware at Divert and it will be hosted and fully managed.\r\n-Create a private mining farm:\r\nDivert creates and fully manages your own mining farm.","Divi":"Divi is a project with the goal of making popular cryptocurrencies easy to use for the public mass.

Compared with other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin had a fast initial coin production schedule: 100 billion coins were in circulation by mid-2015, with an additional 5.256 billion coins every year thereafter. As of 30 June 2015, the 100 billionth Dogecoin had been mined. \r\n\r\nDogecoin was created by Billy Markus from Portland, Oregon and  Jackson Palmer from Sydney, Australia. Both wanted to create a fun cryptocurrency that will appeal beyond the core Bitcoin audience. Dogecoin is primarily used as a tipping system on Reddit and Twitter where users tip each other for creating or sharing good content. The community is very active in organising fundraising activities for deserving causes.\r\n\r\nThe developers of Dogecoin haven’t made any major changes to the coin since 2015.

Their Github release was November 1st. However, before the launch of the mobile app, they were hit by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. The team had to shut down their servers and work over 26 hours straight to deal with the attack. Eventually, after some delay, ICO investors were distributed their coins and Electroneum continued working towards their goal of spreading ETN to the masses. Over 690 million ETN were transferring during the first 24 hours, requiring only 430 ETN in fees. Electroneum calls itself the first British based cryptocurrency.

Electroneum once again hopes to reduce friction and encouraging gambling sites to accept the currency. As mentioned previously, due to the ASIC resistant nature of the Electroneum mining algorithm, it’s still feasible to mine coins with just your CPU.

Fusion uses the Hierarchical Hybrid Consensus Mechanism (HHCM) that borrows things from PoW and PoS. At the same time, it uses a parallel computing by grouping nodes together, creating an efficient and safe platform.\r\n\r\nThe Fusion team used in its whitepaper the term Internet of Values which refers mostly to cryptocurrency related matters, such as the exchange and management of digital assets securely and without intermediaries. The Distributed Control Right Management is a security layer that protects all locked-in cryptocurrency assets on the Fusion blockchain. The distributed storage and sharding of a private key ensures that no one can have access the complete private key, meaning that no single node can gain control of the digital assets. Along with the traditional transaction triggering mechanism, FUSION incorporated time and event based triggers into its smart contracts. These three triggering modes have resulted from various financial situations, and have been designed to meet the requests of complex financial smart contracts.\r\n\r\nBitSE, the company behind the Fusion Project, was founded in 2013 by Dejun Qian, being also responsible for the creation of QTUM and VeChain. QTUM and VeChain are both blockchain foundations which developed into independent ventures. The native token of the Fusion platform, FSN, will be used in paying network fees.

A total of 11,000,000,000 FUN tokens were created on June 22, 2017, and no more will be created. With a fixed supply, the token is deflationary and should experience sharp increases in price over time as demand for it increases.

Casinos can also stake the FUN tokens in their bankrolls to receive additional dividends.\r\n\r\nThe 30+ person FunFair team is based out of London and is led by Jez San, OBE.

FuturoCoin’s code is extended version of Dash's code. Thanks to that, we have access to new solutions and upgrades, created by Dash society and our team.\r\n\r\nFuturoCoin (FTO) was created in response to market demand for cryptocurrency which would allow retailers to accept payments from buyers safely and immediately. This goal was achieved using two mutually complementing tiers of nodes. The first tier, ordinary nodes, is responsible for maintaining proper functioning of the entire decentralized blockchain network. The second tier, or masternodes, is responsible for the specific functionalities introduced by FuturoCoin. It provides, in particular, immediate execution of all transactions (InstantSend) with simultaneous protection against double spending. In addition, FuturoCoin developers, who know about scalability issues occurring in other cryptocurrencies, have used the second tier of nodes to maintain a minimum and fixed transaction fee. FuturoCoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network.\r\nFuturoCoin is now mainly used by over 2 mln community of clients of FutureNet network. \r\n","FUUPAY":"Global Artwork Payment Solution","FUZE Token":"What is FUZE?\r\nFUZE Token is a fully community-driven social experiment and the world’s first self-deflationary currency with a supply of 1000 tokens and a 5% burn rate.\r\n\r\nWhy FUZE?\r\nA difference between FUZE and most other deflationary projects is that there is no dev holding/allocation — every token was distributed fairly by airdrops. This distinguishes FUZE as a token created entirely for its community.\r\n\r\nWhat’s the purpose of the FUZE project?\r\nOur main goal is to build a community that decides in which direction the FUZE Token should go. Future functions or use-cases can be built by any member of the community. Of course, the main function right now is the deflationary token model — this means the total supply decreases with each transaction.\r\n\r\nWhy a deflationary token?\r\nWe like the concept of this kind of token model because it exemplifies the hodler mentality. Let’s say you buy FUZE Tokens for 1 ETH — you are incentivized to hold your FUZE because each time you send it to another address, 5% will be burned. This naturally encourages hodling, rather than sending. This token burn will naturally drive token appreciation through driving an increase in scarcity vs demand.","FuzeX":"","FuzzBalls":"FuzzBalls is a coin initially intended for gifting and parties, .You mine this to gift people, in IRC rooms or Chat rooms.

This is a retail experience and only in a centralized model can Galaxy eSolutions fully control quality of supplied goods and consumer experience. However, Galaxy eSolutions believes that a blockchain, or decentralized model, would suit a marketplace serving the C2C, C2B and B2B markets.

It aims to allow players to earn money from their hobby. And, within a year, the developers claim the capitalization of GameCoin will “exceed and billion dollars and will continue to grow rapidly.”\r\nGameCoin is being proposed as a way to monetize the world of free gaming. The GameCoin whitepaper explains that the majority of gaming revenue comes from 10% of users. Today, developers are struggling to monetize the remaining 90% of users. GameCoin claims to have found a way to do that using blockchain technology.\r\n\r\nBasically, GameCoin’s idea is to allow each game developer to create their own cryptocurrency. This cryptocurrency is used as in-game money. The developers can create this cryptocurrency at virtually no cost to themselves – it’s just a digital token that has value in the game. However, by the time it circulates through gamers, the token will have value because it can be used to pay for in-game items.\r\n\r\nIn more straightforward terms, GameCoin plans to make it easy for developers to create a secure in-game currency. It appears that these cryptocurrencies will operate as forks on the GameCoin blockchain. Each developer will be able to make their own fork – so gamers can easily apply their GWC tokens to any game of their choice (the GameCoin wallet will support all forks).","GameBet":"GameBet is a platform allowing users to gamble on sports and eSports matches.","GameCash":"GameCASH is the next MasterNODE coin created by gamers, for the gamers.","Game Chain":"Game Chain is an online game community creation platform.

The gAsp blockchain also has 4MB blocks to allow for more transactions while supporting a block time average of 2 minutes. gAsp is a decentralized minable blockchain, currently there is no financial gain or reward for mining the blockchain. This reward may change later in order to support future smart contract implementation on Aspire. \r\n\r\ngAsp is an open-source experimental blockchain project built using code from Bitcoin, Litecoin, Peercoin as well as small bits of code from other projects in the space. gAsp was built specifically for Aspire https://aspirecrypto.com/ but also is a standalone blockchain and does not require Aspire in order to operate. \r\n\r\nHow Many GASP Coins Are There in Circulation?\r\n\r\ngAsp launched its mainnet on July 4th, 2020 with 1 billion GASP tokens created at genesis.

The gAsp blockchain mainnet was launched on July 4th, 2020. \r\nJim Blasko is a blockchain developer and crypto pioneer known for mining Bitcoin in late 2010, and developing early altcoins such as UnbreakableCoin, Voxels, eBoost, and X-Coin. Jim is the founder of Bitcoin Talk Radio, and Cryptos.io. He has taken roles on other teams including Lunch Money, Talent Joe, FLASH, NetCoin, PIVX, Jewelz, Guardium, Neutron, and Minex. In 2013 Jim teamed up with Michael Terpin to launch bCommerce Labs, a blockchain incubator. Jim is actively found at Bitcoin conventions as a speaker and is now leading Aspire/gAsp.\r\nMichael Terpin is founder and CEO of Transform Group , whose divisions include Transform PR, a global public relations firm that has served more than 200 clients in the blockchain field and helped launch more than 100 ICO’s, including Aeternity, Augur, Dent, Ethereum, Factom, Golem, MaidSafe, and Neo; Michael is also the founder of CoinAgenda, a global event series for cryptocurrency investors and blockchain innovators since 2014 and Transform Strategies, the company’s advisory division.\r\n\r\nHow is the Aspire Network Secured?\r\n\r\nAspire and the assets/tokens created on Aspire are secured via [proof-of-work]( https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake/) mining on the gAsp blockchain. The gAsp blockchain is protected by checkpointing every block preventing 51% attacks and double spending on the Aspire platform.\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Aspire Unique?\r\n\r\nAspire improves on speed, cost, and security for creating both fungible and non-fungible digital assets and tokens. \r\nEasy to use - Aspire allows anyone to create assets/tokens in under two minutes.\r\nSpeed – Instant transactions and two-minute confirmations make Aspire 5 times faster than Bitcoin.\r\nCost Efficient - 1 GASP allows more than 300,000 transactions of any asset created on the Aspire platform making it the most cost-effective platform in the world.\r\nSecurity – The first asset creation platform running on a [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake/) blockchain secured with advanced checkpointing.\r\n\r\n","Gastoken":"GasToken is a new, cutting-edge Ethereum contract that allows users to tokenize gas on the Ethereum network, storing gas when it is cheap and using / deploying this gas when it is expensive. Using GasToken can subsidize high gas prices on transactions to do everything from arbitraging decentralized exchanges to buying into ICOs early. GasToken is also the first contract on the Ethereum network that allows users to buy and sell gas directly, enabling long-term \"banking\" of gas that can help shield users from rising gas prices.\r\n\r\nGas is a fundamental resource in the Ethereum network. Every transaction on the network must include some gas, and the fee paid to miners for each transaction is directly proportional to the gas consumed by a transaction. GasToken allows a transaction to do the same amount of work and pay for less gas, saving on miner fees and costs and allowing users to bid higher gas prices without paying correspondingly higher fees. Using GasToken on an eligible transaction, you can save money on the Ethereum network today.\r\n\r\nGas prices on Ethereum are hard to predict; they can be as cheap as 1 gwei or less at off-peak hours, while some transactions pay into the hundreds of gwei to buy into that juicy ICO or hit an order on EtherDelta before any other players. Users who need to be mined quickly or first often engage in fierce bidding wars, bidding wars in which using GasToken provides an enormous advantage by letting you perform the same transactions while spending less gas.\r\n\r\nCompounding this effect, Ethereum blocks are starting to fill up, making block space ever more coveted.","GastroAdvisor":"GastroAdvisor is building the first global recommendation platform for restaurants and dining venues based on blockchain Ethereum.

Workers stake tokens in order to prove validity of their tasks and earn a reusable computed trust score, enhancing the cost-efficiency of the network while democratizing access to scalable micro task workers.\r\n\r\nGems, a decentralized, open-sourced, human task crowdsourcing protocol built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. Using the Gems Protocol, anyone can tap into the power of scalable micro task workers without needing to worry about task verification, trust, or payments. Gems is designed to disincentivize malicious actors and reward fair players. The Gems Protocol is comprised of a staking mechanism to ensure task completion, a trust mechanism to track worker integrity, and a payment system to reduce transaction fees. The GEM token, a multi-utility token, fuels the Gems Protocol. Gems uses its token mechanism to enforce the behavior of all participants, instead of being regulated by a single operator.\r\n\r\nGems Protocol, aptly named the Gems Platform. The Gems Platform connects those who want work done (henceforth known as “requesters”) and human workers (henceforth known as “miners”). By using the Gems Protocol, the Gems Platform removes socioeconomic barriers that exist in centralized alternatives (e.g. large fees, market inefficiencies, need for bank accountants, etc.). Anyone can build on top of the Gems Platform, creating “modules” that are interfaces for particular human tasks. The first module the Gems team will build focuses on labeling data for AI.","GemSwap":"SushiSwap fork without dev grant and deflationary tokenomics","GemVault Coin":"GemVault is a marketplace and platform on which the fine gemstones of the world have been placed on the Blockchain and able to be traded digitally for the first time. These assets are available in a global exchange whereby ownership can be transferred from person to person or institution to institution.\r\n\r\nGemVault is a new type of currency. Many national currencies of the world are no longer backed by anything but faith. There is no gold, silver, or other valuable commodity to anchor them to reality. Goods and services priced in these currencies are subject to inflation as the value of it deflates away through uncontrolled increase in the money supply. \r\n\r\nThe crypto-currencies offered by GemVault are tied directly to assets that have been valued and trusted for thousands of years. We make sending the value contained by gems as easy as sending an email. We combine the best of all worlds in this one-of-a-kind endeavor. No longer will the purchasing power of your 'transactionary' currency be eaten away by time. The value of fiat currencies always returns to their intrinsic value, zero. No longer will you be stifled by portability and fungibility problems presented by gold. Useful as it may be as a store of value, it is impractical for daily usage due to its' weight and difficulty to divide accurately into smaller quantities. And no longer will we face the issue of liquidity faced by gemstones. Lighter than gold but yet impossible to divide, we now offer a solution that has plagued humanity since the beginning of the recognition of gemstones as valuable and desirable. \r\n\r\nWhat we offer is simple. Whereas most crypto-currencies are backed by nothing and are mere copies, clones, or identical forked code of more famous ones, and yet others serve some sort of functional capacity, GemVault Coin also has a functional use while its' creations are backed by real assets. We will begin with GemVault Coin. GemVault Coin functions as a type of gate key to all of the other asset tokens offered by GemVault. We will provide our own exchange, upon which all of our assets will be traded. The assets, which are in fact crypto-currencies, are only able to be purchased with GemVault Coin. These cryptographic assets are backed by all natural, untreated, high-quality, and certified gemstones.","Genaro Network":"Genaro Network is the first Turing Complete Public Chain with Decentralized Storage Network, providing blockchain developers a one-stop solution to deploy smart contracts and store data simultaneously.

There are two key functions of attention addresses:\r\n\r\nXAC-LOCK\r\nXAC-Lock is a feature that encourages continued consumer engagement with AMARK. The XAC sent to Attention Addresses is initially locked and becomes available after a maturation period. The XAC attention awards paid to consumers continually matures into availability as new XAC is earned from ongoing attention marketing. This process encourages engagement with AMARK as attention wallets will rarely have a zero XAC balance, giving consumers a consistent flow of value to spend within the ecosystem.\r\n\r\nXAC-BURN\r\nXAC-Burn is enforced at the protocol level. All transfers to Attention Addresses require 5% of the XAC transferred to be burned. The XAC -Burn feature is designed to align interests between merchants and consumers in the AMARK ecosystem. Anytime merchants use the AMARK platform for marketing, they are supporting the value of the XAC currency as protocol rules enforces a 5% burn. As such, merchants are effectively scaling the supply of XAC to match the demand from the ecosystem. This supply-side scaling mechanism will offset new coins introduced through block rewards and pressure the price of XAC to an equilibrium reflective of demand from the ecosystem.","Generation of Yield":"Main Governance and Access Token to Generation of Yield","GENES Chain":"GENES Chain Blockchain-based genome-wide database service platform\r\nGENES Chain is a blockchain-based genome-wide detection database service, dedicated to the establishment of an open, transparent, and co-governing decentralized ecosystem for genetic testing data collaboration organizations.

Through research into the social environment of villages in multiple countries, the team discovered that villages and cities have major differences. Villages are mainly acquaintance societies which have gradually formed semi-closed social networks characterized by blood relations, human relationships, and the pattern of difference sequence. These kinds of social relationships have limited the development of villages, as well as curbed their economic growth.\r\n\r\nIt is precisely those limitations of village society that the GlobalVillage Ecosystem Foundation saw when it decided to start off with the establishment and maintenance of village networks, in order to gradually set up a distributed, coordinated blockchain network based in villages around the world, with peer-to-peer task allocation and reliable identity verification.\r\n\r\nIn the GlobalVillage Ecosystem blockchain network, the distributed task-allocation system uses task-confirmation certificates to record the execution and feedback of tasks on the chain, and the service system uses rights certificates to record the confirmation and reception of service on the blockchain. Furthermore, a reliable, smart contract and transaction system uses transaction and exchange certificates to record exchanges of property on the chain.\r\n\r\nThe credibility of the GlobalVillage Ecosystem network ecosystem comes from the transparency of its event records; the key to this is that the maintenance of the global network system is based on a distributed form of operation, creating a globalized applied ecology. During the distributed operation of the network system, members who are carrying out maintenance on the network system can use GlobalVillage Ecosystem’s digital service layer to freely, efficiently, and transparently participate in verification and assessment work regarding task allocation, task execution, content transmission, and message and transaction confirmation.","Globex":"Globex aims to become the first cryptocurrency exchange in east europe region also build one of the most profitable bitcoin mining farm.","Glosfer Token":"Creator of a number of DApps,\r\n\r\nGLOSFER aims to increase the number of DApps that can be used in everyday life.","GloveCoin":"Stemmed from an idea after seeing and acquiring many new coins, we decided to research and learn the difficulties associated with creating a new currency.

The platform includes a multisig wallet as well as a Dutch Exchange, but we’re just going to focus on their flagship product, the prediction market, for this guide. More than just building a prediction market, though, Gnosis is creating an entire infrastructure layer that you can use to build your own prediction market app. A prediction market utilizes user predictions to aggregate information about future events. \r\n\r\nUsers in the market trade tokens that represent the outcome of a certain event. Because some outcomes are more likely to occur than others, these tokens end up having different values in the open market.Olympia is Gnosis’s test version of their prediction market app. They host free tournaments in this product, so you get a chance to try it out without having to spend money. Every two days, the team allocates you a certain amount of Olympia (OLY) tokens that you use to bet on different prediction markets. If you do well in the market, you win Gnosis (GNO) tokens. You can sell GNO on the open market which gives them some monetary value. The next phase of Gnosis is its Management Interface. The team released a beta version in December 2017 but haven’t announced a date for the main net release. The Management Interface is basically your dashboard for Gnosis’s prediction markets. It’s here that you check your balance, participate in markets, and even create your own market.\r\n\r\nGnosis includes two types of tokens: Gnosis (GNO) and OWL. GNO are the ERC20 tokens that the team sold during their ICO. They created 10 million GNO tokens and aren’t minting any additional ones. These are the tokens that you see being traded on the open market. By staking GNO, you receive OWL tokens. To do this, you must lock your GNO in a smart contract making them non-transferable. The amount of OWL you receive is dependent on the length of your lock period as well as the total supply of OWL tokens in the market. The team is aiming to have 20x more total OWL than the average amount of monthly OWL usage over the previous 3 months.\r\n\r\nThe Gnosis team is led by Martin Köppelmann (CEO), Stefan George (CTO), and Dr. Friederike Ernst (COO). Köppelmann and George began working on the platform in January 2015 as one of the first ConsenSys partners. By August of that same year, they launched the alpha product as the first major dapp on Ethereum. In April 2017, the project held somewhat of a controversial <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/ico/gnosis\">Initial Coin Offering (ICO)</a>. Using a dutch auction style of raising funds, the team hit their $12.5 million hard cap in ten minutes while retaining 95% of the tokens. Amidst backlash, the team locked the tokens in a vault and have promised not to dump them on the market. They’ll give at least a three-month warning before selling any of the tokens. The team includes quite a list of reputable advisors including Joseph Lubin (Ethereum co-founder and ConsenSys founder) and Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum founder and chief scientist).","GNY":"GNY introduces machine learning to pre-existing blockchains, offering smart APIs that bridge to Ethereum, to Asch, to Lisk and any developer working with our universal system.

Designed for everyday use, Groestlcoin features an average block time of one minute, as opposed to Bitcoin's ten. As a consequence, it has a maximum total supply that will cap out at 105 million coins, as opposed to the 21 million for Bitcoin. The main idea of creating Groestlcoin was to establish an electronic payment model that was purely based on mathematical proof. It uses the proof of work system (POW) to facilitate secure online money transactions. This is a system that is independent of influence from centralized authorities.\r\n\r\nHow does it work?\r\n\r\nGroestlcoin is mined using the Groestl algorithm. Groestl was chosen as one of the five finalists of the NIST hash function competition. It uses the same S-box as AES in a custom construction. The cryptocurrency operates as open source software on a peer-to-peer model (transactions take place directly between the payer and payee). This means that no trusted intermediary such a bank or PayPal is required to verify the details of the sender and receiver. Rather, the transactions are verified by nodes (the network of computers/users spread globally) and recorded in an open ledger.\r\n\r\nWhat does it aim to solve?\r\n\r\nWith a shorter block period than Bitcoin, Groestlcoin aims to be more functional for everyday payments. Merchants don’t need to wait 10 minutes to confirm whether or not they have received their payment. The reduction in hashrate intensity also gave Groestlcoin an opportunity to be mined by individuals with less computing power. However, companies and teams have created ASICs for Groestlcoin, albeit at a higher cost than creating ASICs for Bitcoin. Rather than just a simple fork, Groestlcoin also works to adopt developments and additions inspired from discussions surrounding the Bitcoin network, and was actually one of the first adopters to several key features such as Segregated Witness (SegWit) and the Lightning Network.","GrowersCoin":"Growers International is a crypto based membership platform for the Cannabis Industry.

Alongside ION, Economy, a digital entertainment platform for gamers and game developers was also launched in April 2016. ION is based mostly on the idea of making it easier for game developers to incentivize participation in both their premium and free games. The motto of the ION cryptocurrency platform economy is “The Business of Fun”, and it mainly tries to add a social component to digital currency, making it fun and bringing in the possibility for networking.\r\n\r\nION is a digital currency which is primarily given as rewards and incentives to gamers playing on its platform, Economy. It aims to make cryptocurrency fun and social, while simultaneously rewarding gamers for participation. The ION cryptocurrency works on the “static proof-of-stake” consensus system, which ensures that inactive investors cannot take advantage of it. The “Connectivity” system it works on makes the rewards proportional to the number of active users, promoting the community and keeping things fair while encouraging more people to participate. ION has also implemented a master node network, which can be used to perform advanced functions and ensure smoother and much faster transactions for larger holders.\r\n\r\nThe best part of ION, perhaps, is that ION tokens are given as a reward to gamers playing on the economy platform, and they are free to trade the coins for other cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies, too. Rather than other popular cryptocurrencies that focus on buying and selling of goods and are investment-centric (like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a>), ION is focused on the gaming sector. It aims to give active gamers an incentive for participation and game developers a chance to add monetary incentives to their freedom as well as premium games. It’s focused on “everything that’s fun”, according to the ionomy website, whose very motto is “The Business of Fun”.\r\n\r\nFor a cryptocurrency launched before the crypto boom in 2017, ION has its advantages, the main one being that it boasts of being “fun”, unlike any other currency. The reward of winning is adequate for a true gamer, but an incentive involving money doesn’t hurt. Games on the ION platform like “To The Moon (Beta)” and “Crypto Gravity” (available for both Android and iOS) are gaining ground among gamers, and ION can only go up from where it is currently. Another perk of the ION cryptocurrency is that if you invest in it, in-app purchases on the games in the ION platform come much cheaper. ION developers offer up to 50% off on the purchases, if ION tokens are used. The cryptocurrency has just about started gaining ground within the gaming community, and its motto of “fun” and accessible nature are its selling points, making it likely to give returns in the long term.","IONChain":"IONC is the official token of IONChain. It can be utilized by different participants in IONChain ecosystem. The maximum supply of IONC is 800 million. It is going to be released gradually for 20 years. After 20 years, the administrative committee elected by IONChain users using the consensus mechanism will decide whether to re-issue IONC tokens based on the amount of on-chain devices, amount of data being processed and the overall level of IONC abundance in the ecosystem.\r\nIoT devices and data access constitute the core parts of IONChain ecosystem, therefore IONC token is going to be used to reward devices and data providers. The yearly supply of IONC tokens increases along with the demand for data access. However, the upper limit is pre-set.\r\n\r\nIONC token is an indispensable part of the IONChain system as it is a single most crucial part of its ecIONChain aims to solve a wide range of the current problems of IoT networks in terms of data security, data circulation, data sharing and data transactions, thus enhancing the efficiency of the whole IoT ecosystem. IONChain introduces the concept of “One Device, One Coin, One Code” which facilitates the integration of IoT devices with the IONChain blockchain network. With the use of Edge Computing technology, it enables every device on the IoT network to be utilized as a mining machine, making every IoT device that uses IONChain subject to mining rewards. Owing to the use of blockchain technology, the data source will always be reliable and verifiable on the IONChain network. Furthermore, the value ofthe data is quantified and data transfers are fast and secured. This makes it easier for IoT standards to emerge, unlocks a plethora of new IoT application scenarios and boosts the whole industry to enter the next level of development.","IOOX System":"Everyday people in fact carry out transactions of less than 10 dollars a day, ioox coin will make a breach in the hearts of these people.

Led by a team of proven founders and backed by $40 million from world-class investors, including Sequoia and Matrix, IOST aims to be the underlying architecture for the future of online services.\r\n\r\nThe powerful consensus algorithm “Proof-of-Believability” enables next-gen transaction throughput speeds while ensuring nodes stay compliant, using factors including IOST token balance, reputation-based token balance, network contributions and user behaviors. A faster grade Byzantine Fault Tolerance mechanism, microstate blocks, Atomic Commit protocol and a dynamic sharding protocol (Efficient Distributed Sharding) all ensure transactions are safeguarded, consistent and lightning fast while reducing storage, configuration costs and processing power for validators. \r\n\r\nAnyone is able to participate in every layer of our system, from using services on our blockchain to running a node and validating transactions. Our rules and code are open for all to see and no preconditions will limit participation. IOST aims to fundamentally disrupt previous methods of business by creating a self-operated, trustless network that maximizes network value for all parties. The project places great emphasis on decentralized and secure ways of storing information. It also provides for Dapps and smart contracts, and anyone who is familiar with blockchain technology knows just how integral these two concepts have become.\r\n\r\nAdhering to the quintessential egalitarian values of blockchain technology, IOST is creating a censorship-resistant and trustless network that is open to all, using blockchain technology to cut out middlemen and maximize network value for all parties. \r\n\r\nTerrace Wang, Kimmy Zhong, and Ray Xiao, who are extremely brilliant, have co-founded the project. In addition to these original three, the project has 12 employees and 4 advisors. It is also worth noting that Ryan Bubiski, a co-founder of CodeAcademy and a winner of Times Most Influential People award plays a major role in the advisory board of the project. The team has partnered with about sixteen blockchain and cryptocurrency oriented companies such as Sequoia, Nirvana Capital, and DFund. The project, therefore, has strong investors.\"","IOTA":"IOTA is a distributed ledger for the Internet of Things. The first ledger with microtransactions without fees as well as secure data transfer. Quantum proof. IOTA is a ground breaking new open-source distributed ledger that does not use a blockchain.

IOTA is initially focused on serving as the backbone of the Internet-of-Things (IoT).\r\n\r\nIOTA is a cryptocurrency that has no transaction fees and requires no miners in order to process transactions. It does, however, require some computational power to submit a transaction, making it perfect for machines to use as a currency and distributed communication protocol for the Internet of Things “IoT”. The main purpose of IOTA is to solve some of the major problems with Blockchain technology, the main one being that the bigger the Blockchain (such as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a>), the slower, more expensive, and also more restricting it is to actually transfer funds. Another issue with the Blockchain is size, as more and more Blocks are added, the longer the Blockchain gets, and therefore the less amount of computers are able to mine it. Right now BTC is over 150GB long, and so is <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">ETH</a>. If this size increased tenfold, very few computers would be able to mine it at all. Making them relatively centralized (the top 2 Bitcoin mining pools own about 56% of hashing power).\r\n","IoT Chain":"ITC is designed to solve the severe safety problems of present IoT.

Consistently recognized as one of the world’s most innovative blockchain projects, Komodo is developing technologies at the cutting-edge of the blockchain industry. \r\n\r\nIn reality, most blockchain platforms today are but a single blockchain that offers support for smart contracts and decentralized applications. This model forces all projects to share the same infrastructure, leading to congestion, increased transactions fees, and stifled growth. \r\n\r\nWhereas other blockchain platforms employ a single, shared-blockchain model, Komodo’s federated multi-chain architecture provides each and every external project with independent infrastructure and a dedicated blockchain. \r\n\r\nThis multi-chain design is what makes Komodo unique among blockchain platforms. Each project is given the opportunity to create their own blockchain ecosystem via Komodo’s infinitely scalable infrastructure. \r\n\r\nKomodo’s tech enables seamless cross-chain interoperability among all federated blockchains. Every blockchain built with Komodo is also connected to 95% of chains outside the federation via atomic swap technology. Future plans are in place for blockchain bridging support, which will create cross-chain fungibility throughout the entire blockchains industry. \r\n\r\nMoreover, with Komodo’s architecture, multiple blockchains can sync up and function as a single chain. If one chain is not meeting performance needs, additional chains can be added to form a blockchain cluster. A blockchain cluster boosts performance linearly without inflating coin supply or devaluing the currency. \r\n\r\nThe Komodo ecosystem is not only scalable and interoperable, it’s also secured with the power of the Bitcoin network. This is accomplished with a series of cross-chain notarizations that store a blockhash onto the Bitcoin ledger every ten minutes, providing protection from 51% attacks. \r\n\r\nJoin Komodo as we continue to accelerate the global adoption of blockchain technology.

","Mithril":"Mithril is a decentralized ecosystem on the ethereum blockchain. It is a system that rewards users who engage in “social mining”. Mithril rewards users for the impact their content may have in viewers and the popularity it attracts, such as number of likes and views.  In the blockchain network and cryptocurrency, Mithril is a very innovative idea that aims to change the way we think about social media entirely. This particular innovation will decentralize and reward social media content creators in a fair and open way.The process of building a social media platform from the scratch is a long, rigorous and exhausting one. Even though blockchain based social media platforms are not new innovations, they usually cannot interact with existing platforms. The Mithril integration protocol permits MITH mining on all social media networks. Therefore, Mithril can also leverage existing sites for their own purposes. In addition, it permits content influencers to make use of their pre-existing followers network to mine Mithril. This acts as a big plus to the Mithril ecosystem. It requires less stress and work than establishing followers on an entirely new platform. It also helps Mithril to have an edge and a bigger pool of users. This means that, content providers only need to start making use of the Mithril integration protocol in order to make more money.\r\n\r\nInstead of an ICO, Mithril held a private crowdsale where 400,000,000 MITH was distributed and 50,000,000 was retained by the Mithril team for development and marketing. Mithril MITH tokens are mined by participating on partner applications and this social mining is a gamechanger. Creating and sharing content earns Mithril MITH, which can then be spent with partner applications. Because mythril is a crafting ingredient in the Final Fantasy video game series, online searches for how to spend MITH have these pages mixed in, which will likely continue for several years until the platform gains enough big-name retail spending partners to rise up SEO rankings.\r\n\r\nMITH is currently available on Bithumb and OKEx, but more exchanges will likely list the token soon. Although exchanges are never the best place to store your cryptocurrencies due to security concerns, this is one possibility. Better would be to store them using an ERC-20 wallet that allows you to add custom tokens, such as MyEtherWallet, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/how-to-use-mycrypto-desktop-app?locale=en\">MyCrypto</a>, or Coinfy.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Mithril platform and its flagship social network Lit are still in fairly early development, as an early mover, they are poised to be a leader in the decentralized social networking space. If Mithril gets its way, centralized social networking companies may soon have worthy competitors that offer users more control of their data while rewarding people for creating the content that is ultimately the life-blood of all social networks.","Mixin":"Mixin Network is a free and lightning fast peer-to-peer transactional network for all digital assets.

MOAC offers more including, A layered configuration structure, Asynchronous contract calls, Sharding solutions and Pluggable validation schemes.\r\n\r\nTransactions are processed through several consensus systems. The rate is 100 times faster than current blockchain platforms. Sub-chains increase concurrency rates up to 10,000 times. Sub-chains reduce cost and create a test environment. Cross-chain connections allow users and dApps to migrate to the MOAC platform without any knowledge. There’s also a decentralized file storage system. MOAC uses a Proof-of-Work system that allows miners to mine the main chain and sub-chains. Mining can be done from mobile devices. PoW algorithms deter third-party interference, including denial of service attacks and spamming. Sharding is another notable feature in MOAC. This is a method for allocating processing power. The amount of processing power given is proportional to the number of nodes in the network. Large blockchain shards are divided into groups of small shards that are fast.\r\n\r\nMOAC has lofty ambitions: it uses multichain architecture with microchains built on top of the MOAC base layer. It also plans to enable crosschain atomic swaps between blockchains like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> or Ethereum, just like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/komodo\">Komodo</a> does. Both intend to do so via sharding. The MOAC testnet launched November 2017, and the MOAC ERC-20 token and wallet were created in February 2018. Mainnet MOAC launched at the end of April 2018 with Ethereum support, and a mainnet explorer is available on the MOAC.io website. Sharding is due for a December 2018 release. Tokenized MOAC transactions occur on the base layer, and sidechains handle smart contracts. Sidechain creators determine their individual consensus model, so traditional models like Proof-of-Stake or Proof-of-Skill can be used, along with new hybrid models.\r\n\r\nMOAC aims to be the mother of all cryptocurrencies, and its ambitions are backed by one of the strongest technical teams in blockchain. Based in China, the team has experience in blockchain, enterprise IT, and more. MOAC is a Proof-of-Work algorithm whose token started as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network. This base layer supports tokenization using other consensus mechanisms. MOAC decentralizes block processing using microchains and a technique called sharding. Microchains are cross-compatible and can soon be made cross-compatible with other chains for atomic swaps. MOAC has a strong community mostly based in China, where it has a strong presence across social media. This community can build it into a strong dApp, tokenization, and exchange platform.","MobieCoin":"MobiePay is being developed as a global platform to allow users to spend or send fiat and digital currency anywhere in the world from their mobile phone.

Dubbed by its creators as “the first Japanese cryptocurrency,” the coin has become somewhat of Japan’s national alternative to <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> or <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/litecoin\">Litecoin</a>. Like its predecessors, the coin was created purely to serve as P2P electronic cash, a decentralized digital currency aimed at Japanese citizens. There are a few key differences that set it apart from the coins that came before it, and this guide is dedicated to drawing out these differences. Conceived in December of 2013, Monacoin was officially born on January 1st, 2014 with no premine.\r\n\r\nA Bitcoin Talk Forum on the same date details the coin’s launch and its specifications. A soft fork was executed at block 937440 to implement Segwit, a move made to keep it in line with Bitcoin, Litecoin, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/vertcoin\">Vertcoin</a>, and other payment-focused cryptocurrencies.  In addition, the Monacoin team has reportedly implemented the Lightning Network for their coin. Speaking of soft forks, Monacoin is actually a hard fork of Litecoin, something we’ll take into account further as we look into its specs below. Monacoin was originally founded by the pseudonymous Mr. Wantanabe, no doubt in homage to Bitcoin’s Satoshi Nakamoto.  Besides this pen name, the rest of the coin’s team is completely anonymous, so there’s nothing to report on here. In addition, the project has no visible roadmap on its site or anywhere else online.  The team does seem to stay on top of updates and upgrades, however, as the Segwit and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Lyra2RE&view=market\">Lyra2REv2</a> updates and Lightning Network implementation suggest.\r\n\r\nIt is popular in Japan where it was developed. It Uses Lyra2REv2 and Dark Gravity Wave v3 algorithm to ensure fairer mining opportunities, success rate and difficult levels of mining process respectively. Monacoin is the first cryptocurrency from Japan. It has received wide support and success in the country and is not crossing the national boundary to try and become a global phenomenon. While that is not going to happen in the next year or two, it does have the making of a good crypto token. It is steadily improving its service and has constantly strived to give its users the best possible experience. When <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Scrypt&view=market\">Scrypt</a> compliant ASIC miners appeared they switched to Lyra2REv2 to ensure the mining MONA remains a fair battle between miners from around the world. The instance of a Japanese national using Monacoin to buy land made news in the country and beyond, spreading the popularity of the coin.","Monarch Token":"Monarch is the ultimate payment solution for both businesses and consumers, pairing a CMS plugin for blockchain-payments with a mobile and desktop wallet for consumers.

The Monarch Wallet is able to automate recurring payments with its Patent Pending protocol to enable users to pay their rent, car payment, or Netflix etc in cryptocurrency. The Monarch Wallet is also a fiat gateway to buy or sell crypto back into fiat. Monarch’s mission is to enable all businesses to accept cryptocurrency to promote worldwide adoption of all cryptocurrencies. ","Monero":"What is Monero?\r\nMonero (XMR) is the top <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?category_id=37&view=market\">privacy-centric cryptocurrency</a> based on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Cryptonight\">CryptoNote protocol</a>, a secure, private and untraceable currency system. Monero uses a special kind of cryptography to ensure that all of its transactions are  remain 100% unlinkable and untraceable. In an increasingly transparent world, you can see why something like Monero can become so desirable.\r\n\r\nOrigins of Monero\r\nIn July of 2012, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bytecoin\">Bytecoin</a>, the first real life implementation of CryptoNote, was launched. While Bytecoin had promise, people noticed that 80% of the coins were already published. So, it was decided that the bytecoin blockchain will be forked and the new coins in the new chain will be called Bitmonero, which is was then renamed Monero, meaning “coin” in Esperanto language. In this new blockchain, a block will be mined and added every two minutes.\r\n\r\nWhy Monero?\r\n\r\n#1: Unlinkability - Your identity is completely private\r\n\r\nYou have complete control over your transactions. You are responsible for your money. Because your identity is private no one will be able to see what you are spending your money on. When you send funds to someone’s public address, what happens is that you actually send the funds to a randomly created brand new one-time destination address. \r\n\r\nThis means that the public record does not contain any mention that funds were received to the recipient’s public address. In Monero, your public address will never appear in the public record of transactions. Instead, a 'stealth address' is recorded in a way that only you, the recipient, can recognize the incoming funds.\r\n\r\n#2: Fungibility\r\n\r\nFungibility is interchangeability between one asset and another asset of the same type.\r\n\r\nSuppose you borrowed $50 from your friend, you can even return the money in the form of 1 $50 bill or 5 $10 bill, It is still fine. This shows that the dollar has fungible properties. However, if you were to borrow someone’s car for the weekend and come back and give them some other car in return, then that person will probably punch on the face. Cars, in this example, are a nonfungible asset.\r\n\r\nWhat is <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Cryptonight\">CryptoNote</a>?\r\nCryptoNote is the application layer protocol that fuels various decentralized currencies. While it is similar to the application layer which runs bitcoin in many aspects, there a lot of areas where the two differ from each other. CryptoNote features an entirely new code base and is not a fork of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a>. More info about CryptoNote can be found at their <a href=\"https://cryptonote.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a>. \r\n\r\nCryptoNote uses Ring Signatures to conceal sender identities via mixing and it also has unlinkable transactions that is achieved using 1-time keys for each individual payments. Ring signatures enable ‘transaction mixing’ to occur. Transaction mixing means that when funds are sent, the sender randomly chooses several other users’ funds to also appear in the transaction as a possible source of the funds being sent. \r\n\r\nThe cryptographical nature of the ring signature means that no one can tell which of the funds were really the source of the transaction – not even the person that gave the funds to the sender in the first place. A system of ‘key images’ associated with each ring signature ensures that although no one can tell the true source of the funds, it can be easily detected if the sender attempts to anonymously send their funds twice. \r\n","Monero-Classic":"Monero-Classic (XMC) is a hard fork of Monero (XMR), announced on 29th March. Part of Monero's development is that it hard-forks every 6 months, this is completely normal so not a surprise. After one of these scheduled hard-forks Monero retains the ticker symbol 'XMR' as well as the upgrades from the hard-fork; on the 6th April hard-fork it had changes including resistance to Cryptonight ASIC miners. If people disagree with these hard-forks, they can create their own versions of Monero. The strong financial incentives against this hard-fork, resulted in 4 different entities that each has created versions of Monero that still support ASIC miners, with their own new ticker symbols:\r\n\r\nMonero (XMR), the coin supported by the core Monero development team \r\nMonero Original (XMO), announced on 29th March \r\nMonero 0 (ZMR), shared on Reddit on 31st March 2018 \r\nMoneroClassic (XMC), first Tweet on 4th April 2018 \r\nMonero-Classic (XMC), first Tweet on 5th April 2018\r\n\r\nOn the project website, the person behind Monero-Classic identifies himself as “PZ, an early Bitcoin evangelist and blockchain eco builder”.  PZ's message on the website:\r\n\r\nHello, everyone! I'm PZ, an early Bitcoin evangelist and blockchain eco builder. Most of you know me because of my efforts and adherence to the ecological development of blockchain industry. In the past few years, I saw Bitcoin community and Litecoin community both fell apart for long time due to different ideas , and the development of main chains was unable to move forward. So I organized Litecoin International Round Table Forum and Bitcoin International Round Table Forum in 2017. The two meetings were very successful. The upgrade of Litecoin and Bitcoin also went on successfully.\r\n\r\nRecently, our team noticed that XMR (Monero), the world’s largest anonymous currency, is about to change the PoW algorithm, and plans to further change it twice within 1 year. As we all know, the reason for this algorithm change is that many companies (BITMAIN, PinIdea, etc.) have developed specialized mining machines for Monero. \r\n\r\nActually, the emergence of specialized mining machine for a cryptocurrency is normal market economy phenomenon. In the 10 years since the cryptocurrency community was born, we have seen the birth of specialized mining machine for Bitcoin. Then there emerged Litecoin, which was expected to be against specialized ASIC mining machines, using script algorithm which was considered to be\"against ASIC\" at that time. While after only two years, there appeared specialized mining machine for Litecoin. We considered about whether to change algorithm to be against specialized ASIC mining machines or not. However, after prudent and serious discussion, we believe that for any kind of valuable algorithm, the emergence of mining machine is only a matter of time. Finally, we made our choice to accept the existence of professional mining machines. Now more and more high-value currencies (algorithms) have respondent specialized ASIC mining machines, which has become a common phenomenon in the industry. \r\n\r\nIs the existence of specialized mining machines completely useless? Obviously, this argument is unfair. The emergence of specialized mining machines will indeed accelerate the rise of problems such as centralization of computational power. But we should be reminded the fact that emergence of professional mining machines will also greatly improve network security. If there are professional mining machines, the events like “Monero was attacked by more than 500,000 botnets” could be avoided. \r\n\r\nWe understand that Monero team expects to stick to the expectations and work of Monero's “against ASIC mining machine”. For a long time, due to the excellent work of Monero team, XMR and its community have achieved great development, providing much valuable contributions to the entire cryptocurrency community. In the community, many people agree with this hard fork of changing algorithms. However, I feel that there is still a part of people who want to maintain the original algorithm and accept the existence of mining machines. They should be heard and respected. \r\n\r\nWe believe that the two ideas of \"embrace ASIC mining machines\" and \"against ASIC mining machines\" both have their own strengths and weakness. At present, the vigorous development of the global cryptocurrency ecology is precisely due to the emergence of various ideas of different people. The collision of different ideas has brought out the flourishing of various digital currencies. We always believe that the ecological diversity of cryptocurrency community is much conducive to the birth of a more secure, stable, prosperous and beautiful encrypted world. We can, and should, allow these minority of people, who are adhering to a different idea, be given equal opportunities with the majority, and the free market will make its own choices. \r\n\r\nTherefore, we believe that these two thoughts should be given equal opportunities for development. We will make our best efforts to maintain the Monero system before this algorithm change, thereby preserving the fire that gives the ecology more potential for development. At the same time, we also invite developers, mining machine manufacturers, trading platforms, miners, purses, and others in this ecological chain to join us, so that the network ecology can gain more possibilities! \r\n\r\nXMC wallet GUI for Windows: \r\nhttps://github.com/monero-classic/monero-gui/releases/download/v0.1.0.0/monero-classic-wallet-gui.zip\r\nMD5：e6dabd083bbaae95fdb87bc0d4aaf483","MoneroV":"MoneroV fulfills the long overdue desire for a truly anonymous, decentralized, finite peer-to-peer electronic currency.","Moneta":"","Moon Juice":"","MoonRabbit":"","MoonSwap":"","MoonTools":"MoonTools is a data explorer for decentralized exchanges.

As a chartered limited purpose trust company with fiduciary powers under the Banking Law, Paxos is able to offer regulated services in the crypto-asset and virtual commodities space.\r\n\r\nThe Paxos team comes from a wide variety of backgrounds with a diverse array of experiences ranging from Wall Street to Silicon Valley. It’s led by CEO and co-founder Charles Cascarilla, who has spent his career as a customer, analyst, investor and now creator of financial technology.\r\n\r\nPaxos describes itself as “the first regulated Trust company with blockchain expertise”, and it is using that expertise to create a modern settlement solution that can eliminate risk and simplify settlements. What many people may not know about Paxos is that it was actually founded in 2012 as Paxos Trust Company, and that for most of its life it ran the cryptocurrency exchange itBit, which is still operates. The creation of Paxos was a pivot from an exchange platform to a company focused on creating a modern settlement platform using blockchain technology.\r\n\r\nPaxos has become the most widely adopted cryptocurrency in the fastest time frame, with support from over 20 exchanges and OTC desks in the first five weeks of its existence. It’s been picked up and listed by six of the top ten cryptocurrency exchanges, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/binance\">Binance</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/okex\">OKEx</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/gate\">Gate.io</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/zb\">ZB</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/kucoin\">KuCoin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/digifinex\">DigiFinex</a>. These exchanges are offering PAX as an alternative to the controversial <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tether\">Tether</a>. Unlike the controversy surrounding the people who control Tether, there is no such obscurity when it comes to the people behind Paxos. The CEO and co-founder is Charles Cascarilla. He has over 15 years in financial services and has co-founded Cedar Hill asset management back in 2005. He has also worked and Bank of America and Goldman Sachs prior to that.\r\n\r\nThe Paxos Standard (PAX) is the first digital asset to be issued by a financial institution and to be fully secured by the U.S. dollar. While other similar stablecoins have existed, there has been no proof of full U.S. dollar reserves, nor have these earlier assets been issued by a financial institution. The Paxos team has been fairly clear in declaring the different base that PAX is working from.

Its most recent progress was the integration of the Phore Blockchain into the marketplace. One of the milestones for 2018 is the activation of Segregated Witness. Phore started out as KryptKoin back in 2014. KryptKoin’s lead developer had to stop the project due to a serious disease. The demise of KryptKoin was followed by the creation of Phore in 2017.\r\n\r\nPhore’s blockchain system operates on the Proof of Stake (PoS) protocol for the purpose of mining. Users are rewarded on the basis of their participation on the platform and the number of stakes they hold. The staking rate is 2.8 PHR per 60 seconds, which means users will receive 2.8 PHR for every block they own after every 60 seconds. The blockchain employs master nodes to fulfil the purpose of security on the Phore network. A minimum of 10,000 PHR is required to enable master node security. The set up process only requires a Virtual Private Server (VPS) and a PC. Masternodes serve additional security to the funds even when the wallet is offline.\r\n\r\nThe targets for Q1 2018 include the development and release of web and Android wallets. The plan is to increase PHR accessibility with the help of wallets. The team plans to work on wallet and core upgrades the whole year long. They also intend to create an automated setup for master nodes. Phore has built an enthusiastic and dedicated community of users despite its new entry in the market. The variety of services that it offers with its innovative technological infrastructure indicates a positive future market growth and an expanding user base.

It enables people across the globe to access credit, and to provide loans. The RCN token is a typical ERC-20 token. This protocol has the smart contract technology embedded into the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> blockchain which facilitates peer-to-peer lending without the hefty transaction fees that are charged in traditional banking processes. The RCN token functions at the core of the system. The inherent value of the token is directly correlated to the demand for its use in the network.\r\n\r\nBased in Argentina, Latin America, Ripio was launched at the TechCrunch Disrupt in May 2016. Sebastian Serrano, founder and CEO of the Ripio Credit Network is a technology enthusiast. He along with his team of technology experts, analysts and developers have designed an impressive concept along with the website, whitepaper and its implementation within the last 2 years. The team comprises of David Garcia (SVP & Board Member), Eugenio Cocimano (Data Scientist), Antonio Ceraso (CTO & Lead Blockchain developer) and Agustin Aguilar (Smart Contracts Developer) among many others. Ripio started off with a primary objective - to democratize the digital economy in Latin America, by offering digital payment alternatives within everyone's reach in a region where 65% remain unbanked.\r\n\r\nThe smart contract is an integral part of the underlying technology of the Ripio Credit Network. It is generated by the Wallet Provider and executed when it is matched by the Credit Exchange. This smart contract contains information like the relevant credit terms, borrower obligations, events of default along with the signatures or verifications from all other agents. RCN tokens facilitate interaction with the smart contracts among different agents within the RCN. Every credit flow starts when the Borrower makes a credit request. The Borrower performs the request from its Wallet Provider, which has already integrated into the RCN protocol. Post this, the Borrower waits for an approval before any further action can be performed.","Ripped":"As we know the practice of physical activity several benefits to the physical and psychological health.

Like other cryptocurrencies, Ripple is built atop the idea of a distributed ledger network which requires various parties to participate in validating transactions, rather than any singular centralized authority. That facilitates transactions all over the world, and transfer fees are far cheaper than the likes of bitcoin. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, XRP transfers are effectively immediate, requiring no typical confirmation time.\n\nRipple was originally founded by a single company, </p><p><a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ripple-labs\">Ripple Labs</a>, and continues to be backed by it, rather than the larger network of developers that continue <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">bitcoin’s</a> development. It also doesn’t have a fluctuating amount of its currency in existence. Where bitcoin has a continually growing pool with an eventual maximum, and Ethereum theoretically has no limit, Ripple was created with all of its 100 billion XRP tokens right out of the gate. That number is maintained with no mining and most of the tokens are owned and held by Ripple Labs itself — around 60 billion at the latest count.\n\nEven at the recently reduced value of around half a dollar per XRP, that means Ripple Labs is currently sitting on around $20 billion worth of the cryptocurrency (note: Ripple’s price crashed hard recently, and may be worth far less than $60 billion by time you read this). It holds 55 billion XRP in an escrow account, which allows it to sell up to a billion per month if it so chooses in order to fund new projects and acquisitions. Selling such an amount would likely have a drastic effect on the cryptocurrency’s value, and isn’t something Ripple Labs plans to do anytime soon.\n\nIn actuality, Ripple Labs is looking to leverage the technology behind XRP to allow for faster banking transactions around the world. While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are built on the idea of separating financial transactions from the financial organizations of traditional currencies, Ripple is almost the opposite in every sense.\n\nXRP by Ripple price can be found on this page alongside the market capitalization and additional stats.\n\n</p>","Ripple Alpha":"Ripple Alpha is a global cryptocurrency built on blockchain technology.

The Rocket Pool protocol token is used to maintain an optimal capacity by:\r\nIncreasing capacity when needed, by incentivising node operators to join.\r\nDecreasing capacity when not needed, by disincentivising node operators from joining.\r\n\r\nIn addition to depositing ETH, a node operator is required to deposit a set amount of RPL per ether they are depositing. This RPL:ether ratio is dynamic and is dependent on the network utilisation. E.g:\r\nIf the network has plenty of capacity, then node operators need more RPL to make deposits. It gets progressively more expensive in terms of RPL to make node deposits when the network does not have enough ETH from regular stakers to be matched up with node operators. This helps prevent several attack vectors outlined in the whitepaper and keeps assignment of ether ‘chunks’ to nodes quick.\r\nIf the network is reaching capacity, then node operators need less RPL to join as the network needs more node deposits to be matched up with regular users deposits. If the network is maxed out and needs node operators to join quickly, it even drops to 0 for the first one to make a deposit.","Rocket Token":"","Rock N Rain Coin":"We Started Rock n Rain a few months back to bring a new level of excitement to discord servers.

It creates livelihoods for tens of millions of people and feeds billions by tapping the world’s last major source of wild protein. Realizing the potential of blockchain technology in Aquaculture and the hospitality industry, however, requires Aquaculture advocates to understand how seafood supply blockchains work, and that is where SSF blockchain comes in. We will work with Aquaculture advocates and Government Regulators/Inspectors to help them implement the use of SSF blockchain technology as a way to streamline the management and storage of the Shellfish and Seafood Harvest Tag and Parasite Destruction Records requirement and help improve overall Health and Safety standards governments and regulators demand of industry.\r\n\r\nBeginning January 1, 2018 the United States started to enforce its Seafood Import Monitoring Program (SIMP), guaranteed traceability of seafood is set to become even more important than it is now, so NOW is the time to act, and to implement use of SSF blockchain technology to meet new requirements coming to the industry standards.\r\n\r\nOur main goal is to keep the storage of SSHT/PDR information in a secure, tamper resistant way using blockchain technology as cost efficient as possible. That is why we choose a POW coin and not a ERC20 Token. ERC20 tokens are dependent on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain. The ETH blockchain is congested and expensive therefore the cost of doing business on that chain is very high. We decided that we could keep the cost of storing SSHT/PDR data to a minimum by only charging a \"transaction fee\" for payment to the miners to keep a secure network.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhile using Safe SeaFood Coin ($SSF) to help satisfy the inspection, maintenance and record keeping requirements that many government's demand of harvesters, fisheries and restaurateurs (USDA,NSSP,CSSP, The EU's Commission’s Health and Food Audit and Analysis Directorate or any other national government's Shellfish Sanitation Program) you can cut the cost of inventory waste, inspection, storage, record maintenance and keeping requirements by using Blockchain Technology.\r\n\r\nUsing the Safe SeaFood Coin ($SSF) Wallet to input the Shellfish and Seafood Harvest Tag and/or the Parasite Destruction Records information will help the seafood industry cut costs by eliminating product being returned unusable due to lost, ripped or removed Harvest Tags along with a efficient and verifiable way to store that information depending upon your particular requirements.\r\nUsing the Safe Seafood Coin ($SSF) wallet to input the information contained on the Shellfish and Seafood Harvest Tag and/or Parasite Destruction Records will help the Restaurant industry fulfill the requirements of storage by local, state and federal regulations. Currently the tag must remain on the container until all shellfish in the container are sold or discarded. The tag must then be kept on file by the retailer for 90 days. By inputting that information on the SSF blockchain we are able to keep that information accessible to inspectors and health departments for an interminably amount of time and accessible from any computer terminal.\r\nUsing the Safe SeaFood Coin ($SSF) explorer local, state and federal inspector's can retrieve and verify any and all information associated with a wallet address, transaction id and visually see the Shellfish and Seafood Harvest Tag and/or Parasite Destruction Record information.","Sogur":"A token only becomes a currency once it is used by markets as a store of value and means of exchange.

When Dai is worth below $1, mechanisms work to increase the price. The rational actors that take part in these mechanisms do so because they earn money anytime Dai is not perfectly worth $1. This is why Dai is always floating slightly above or below $1 — it is an endless wave function bouncing infinitely close to $1, but never quite achieving it. The farther Dai goes from $1, the more incentive there is to fix it. This is the magic of Dai.\r\n\r\n*How is Dai Created?\r\nDai is simply a loan against Ethereum. By using the MakerDAO dApp, advanced users can take loans out in Dai against their ETH holdings.\r\n\r\nFirst, ETH is turned into “wrapped ETH” (WETH), which is simply an ERC20 wrapping around ETH. This “tokenizes” ETH so it can be used like any other ERC20 token. Next, WETH is turned into “pooled ETH” (PETH), which means it joins a large pool of Ethereum that is the collateral for all Dai created. Once you have PETH, you can create a “collateralized debt position” (CDP), which locks up your PETH and allows you to draw Dai against your collateral, which is PETH. As you draw out Dai, the ratio of debt in the CDP increases. There is a debt limit that sets a maximum amount of Dai you can draw against your CDP. Once you have Dai, you can spend or trade it freely like any other ERC20 token.\r\n\r\n*There are several important reasons why you would create Dai, despite the hassle:\r\n\r\n1. You need a loan, and have an asset (ETH) to use as collateral for your loan\r\n\r\n2. You believe ETH is going up in value. You can use your CDP to buy ETH on margin — you lock up your ETH in a CDP, draw Dai against it, use the Dai to buy more ETH on an exchange, and then use that ETH to further increase the size of your CDP. This can be accomplished without any third-party or centralized authority allowing you to do so — margin trading can be accomplished entirely on the blockchain.\r\n\r\n3. The demand for Dai has driven the price above $1 USD. When this occurs, you can create Dai then immediately sell it on an exchange for greater than $1 USD. This is essentially free money, and is one of the mechanisms the Maker system uses to keep Dai pegged to $1 USD. Dai being worth over $1 USD encourages more Dai to be created.\r\nThese three reasons are enough to ensure that Dai is continually created.","SAINT FAME: Genesis Shirt":"$FAME tokens were launched, and able to be bought and sold before the design of the shirt was known.

Launched as an undergraduate project by Ankit Bhatia & Rob Giometti at UC Berkeley in 2017, Sapien is building a decentralized, private social network built on a foundation of independent, self-governing communities called Tribes which all participate in the SPN token economy.\r\n\r\nThe company is established on a principle of “Humans First,” which means Sapien will stand by these pledges:\r\n\r\nData sovereignty: as a social network, Sapien knows that privacy is paramount and will never collect personal data without consent\r\nSelf-governance: Sapien commits to give communities the tools they need to guide and protect their communities, so it will always be people who moderate and promote content, never an exploitable algorithm\r\nHumanity: Sapien is built by humans for humans, not trolls or bots, and the platform aims to make it incredibly hard for malicious users or content to spread across the network\r\n\r\nSapien aims to build the first Web3 social network for mainstream users by building a familiar social user interface and experience and abstracting away the complexities of blockchain by implementing instant, gasless transactions for the end-user and by reinventing the wallet experience to be simpler and more intuitive.\r\n\r\nSapien aligns its business model with the best interests of its users, so its primary source of revenue is the nominal fees it applies to Charges and Rewards.\r\n\r\nWhile Sapien was originally founded in the United States by Ankit & Rob, the team itself has grown to a team of 20, globally distributed across 10 countries.\r\n\r\nWhat is the SPN token and how does it work?\r\nThe SPN token is an ERC20-compliant utility token that can be used to reward and recognize valuable contributions to the communities, subscribe or purchase access to content shared by creators, and to engage in social-powered e-commerce. With the SPN token, Sapien aims to democratize the power inherent to social media - social, economic, political, technological - by decentralizing the platform controls all the way down to community leaders, rather than a boardroom and a handful of executives.\r\n\r\nCharging\r\nOne feature that separates Sapien from other social platforms is that content sorting is governed by a system of “Charges,” which are tokenized boosts users can give to posts and comments as a reward for their quality. Charges boost the presence of posts in user feeds and reward the post creator/commenter with SPN tokens within 24 hours of the Charge being given. This process gives monetary weight to the liking system commonly employed on social platforms and will enable creators to directly connect with and receive compensation from their audiences.\r\n\r\nStaking\r\nSapien operates on a proof-of-value protocol. Users can stake their SPN tokens using the Sapien smart contract, which progressively unlocks the tokens over the course of a calendar year. Sapien employs a “Stake Rank” system which determines the platform fees charges to users at the points of Charging and collecting rewards, with the user staking more tokens than anyone else receiving the lowest fees and fees being assigned according to Stake Rank.\"","SAPPCHAIN":"SAPPCHAIN is a decentralized end-to-end encrypted anonymous messaging App with peer-to-peer transfer of money and cryptocurrency solutions, based on blockchain technology and powered by Artificial Intelligence that connects people completely free, safe and anonymously.

Shift Storage Cluster - The default state of the IPFS infrastructure is represented as a globally shared network. This can lead to problems when it comes to verifying data integrity, availability, and custom implementation details such as earning token rewards for running a storage node. For this reason, Shift runs a private swarm. The storage nodes use a custom swarm key to ensure that they can only talk to other nodes using the same key. This also prevents Shift nodes being used to host and deliver content that was added outside of the Shift network which should improve reliability and performance. \r\n\r\nIn order to store data permanently, IPFS implements a concept called pinning. Pinning content means that the content will be available permanently (or until it is unpinned). By default the pinning only applies to a single peer that it is pinned to, but that means if that machine goes offline, the content can be lost. The way around this is by using an IPFS cluster: a subnet (or private net) running the IPFS daemon, containing only Shift peers. The Shift cluster runs as a wrapper around the IPFS daemon. It allows the end user to connect a group of IPFS nodes together so that content can be stored and replicated within the group. The cluster elects a leader to be in charge of keeping track of which content is available in which locations.\r\n\r\nShift is meant to disrupt the web hosting industry. The company has created Phantom which is a decentralized app to host websites. It does so through the Shift IPFS rather than the normal way a website is hosted. By using this ‘killer dApp’, the company is of the opinion that a business gets a chance of succeeding in the current competitive world.\r\n\r\nBecause Shift is an open-source platform, developers of dApps are free to use the company’s script. This is made even easier by the fact that Shift Company has used Javascript which is popular language among dApp developers. According to the company, every dApp created using the Shift script can access the IPFS cluster to store data. This will be made possible by the use of a P2P hypermedia distribution protocol, an interplanetary file system which the company created.\r\n\r\nEven though the Shift has been around since 2015, the team only released the whitepaper on March the 5th 2018. The whitepaper is a bit technical but well detailed. Remember that the crypto is built with dApps developers in mind. It might not be a very good investment opportunity for a person who doesn’t understand dApps and Javascript. But at the end of the day, it is a volatile crypto which is one of the most important features to look for as a trader.","Shill":"","Shilling":"","ShineChain":"In an era of blockchain transformation, ShineChain's mission is to change the business model of the global insurance industry through technological innovation, to create a global blockchain mutual assistance ecological model, and to enable more people to enjoy their rights to a safe and healthy life.

This allows Sia users to share files in the platform without having to take it off the cloud while increasing network utilization. Medium-term development’s goal is to enhance partnerships. This means reaching out to large companies like Netflix and Dropbox to hopefully be able to be their storage and distribution framework.

Merge mining is simply the ability for miners to simultaneously mine two different cryptocurrencies based on the same algorithm. The project attempts to remove the middleman and put money directly back into merchants/consumers hands, eliminating hefty fees currently charged by big corporations like Amazon and eBay. To facilitate near-zero fee transactions, you can use its native cryptocurrency, Syscoin (SYS), to pay for goods on the marketplace. However, you can also pay using alternate cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/zcash\">Zcash</a>.\r\n\r\nSyscoin is led by a team of developers and was created by its current core developer, Sebastian Schepis.

The idea was to create a stable cryptocurrency that can be used like digital dollars. Coins that serve this purpose of being a stable dollar substitute are called “stable coins.” Tether is the most popular stable coin and even acts as a dollar replacement on many popular exchanges! According to their site, Tether converts cash into digital currency, to anchor or “tether” the value of the coin to the price of national currencies like the US dollar, the Euro, and the Yen. Like other cryptos it uses blockchain. Unlike other cryptos, it is [according to the official Tether site] “100% backed by USD” (USD is held in reserve). The primary use of Tether is that it offers some stability to the otherwise volatile crypto space and offers liquidity to exchanges who can’t deal in dollars and with banks (for example to the sometimes controversial but leading exchange <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/bitfinex\">Bitfinex</a>).\r\n\r\nThe digital coins are issued by a company called Tether Limited that is governed by the laws of the British Virgin Islands, according to the legal part of its website. It is incorporated in Hong Kong. It has emerged that Jan Ludovicus van der Velde is the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, which has been accused of being involved in the price manipulation of bitcoin, as well as tether. Many people trading on exchanges, including Bitfinex, will use tether to buy other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Tether Limited argues that using this method to buy virtual currencies allows users to move fiat in and out of an exchange more quickly and cheaply. Also, exchanges typically have rocky relationships with banks, and using Tether is a way to circumvent that.\r\n\r\nUSDT is fairly simple to use. Once on exchanges like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/poloniex\">Poloniex</a> or Bittrex, it can be used to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It can be easily transferred from an exchange to any Omni Layer enabled wallet. Tether has no transaction fees, although external wallets and exchanges may charge one. In order to convert USDT to USD and vise versa through the Tether.to Platform, users must pay a small fee. Buying and selling Tether for Bitcoin can be done through a variety of exchanges like the ones mentioned previously or through the Tether.to platform, which also allows the conversion between USD to and from your bank account.","Tether Gold":"Each XAU₮ token represents ownership of one troy fine ounce of physical gold on a specific gold bar. XAU₮, which is available as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain and as a TRC20 token on the TRON blockchain, can be transferred to any on-chain address from the purchasers’ Tether wallet.

It is a smart contract platform which is does not involve in mining Tezos coins. It is a coin that promotes themselves on major ideas of self-amendment and on-chain governance. It is an <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>-like blockchain that hosts smart contracts. It allows the community to vote and improve its flaws. Any token holder may delegate their voting rights to others in the network. The coin uses a generic network shell which allow different transaction and consensus protocols that a blockchain needs to be compatible.\r\n\r\nThe source code is implemented on OCaml which is a fast, flexible and functional programming language which should suit an ambitious project and its technical requirements. Tezos’ proof-of-stake consensus algorithm is different from the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Delegated+Proof-of-Stake&view=market\">delegated proof-of-stake (dPOS)</a> where they go by the name liquid proof-of-stake. This liquid proof-of-stake that Tezos uses focus in filling the gap between both security and decentralization but still being able to take advantage of the benefits that delegated proof-of-stake offers. The staking process in Tezos is called “baking”. In this blockchain, bakers who make deposits will be rewarded for signing up and publishing blocks. However, if a baker commits any bad behavior the deposits will be forfeited.\r\n\r\nBaking & Endorsing\r\nBaking is what Tezos refers to as the action of signing and publishing a new block in the chain. Bakers need at least 8,000 XTZ to qualify as a delegate, and having additional delegated stake increases their chances of being selected as a Baker or Endorser.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of each cycle (4096 blocks), the Bakers for each block are randomly selected and published. Bakers earn a block reward of 40 XTZ for baking a block.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Baker, 32 Endorsers are randomly selected to verify the last block that was baked. Endorsers receive 2 XTZ for each block they endorse.\r\n\r\nBlock Rewards & Inflation\r\nBlock rewards are funded by protocol defined inflation. Rewards are calibrated so that the number of XTZ tokens grows at roughly 5.5% per year. If 100% of Tezos tokens are delegated, the annualized yield will be 5.5%. Currently, 38% of Tezos tokens have been delegated, including the 10% owned by the Tezos Foundation, so the annualized yield is currently 14%.\r\n\r\nTo ensure Bakers and Endorsers act honestly, they are required to post a security deposit for each block they Bake or Endorse. They forfeit this deposit in the event of malicious activity, such as double baking or double endorsing a block.\r\n\r\nIn 2018, Tezos successfully launched their main network after delaying the launch due to corporate governance disputes. The Tezos foundation planned to transition the network to a mainnet, or a more complete version. The foundation has also raised $232 million in July 2017 to build the network and issue a new type of cryptocurrency to its backers in one of the largest- ever initial coin offerings. The founders have also made it clear in their blog that the network is using a new blockchain technology hence unexpected issues may still occur affecting the network.\r\n\r\nCheck out <a href=\"https://www.coinbureau.com/review/tezos-xtz/\">CoinBureau</a> for the complete review of Tezos.","TFE":"","Thaler Group Company":"Our mission is to create a new environment for the FinTech Future and mass adoption of blockchain with the help of our Exchange MoneTAL, Thaler Token, Wallet, N.F.C Payment, Crypto Games..\r\n\r\nEtymologically, Thal (modern: Tal) is German for \"valley\", and a thaler is a person or a thing\"from the valley\".

","XP":"Experience Points, as its mission suggests, it wants to bring XP off the screen and into your daily routine. The project is building a sharing economy for all aspects of life, anything from daily purchases to tourism, all driven by the XP coin.  With Experience points, distribution is limited only to adoption and acceptance; if an industry or service adopts the project’s model, you can earn XP coin for your everyday experiences.\r\n\r\nExperience Points (XP) is a completely independent, platform agnostic incentive rewards token and digital currency combined enabling you to earn XP through video games, activities, sports, education and conservation which you can then spend at participating vendors either online, in-game, or on the high street (cryptocurrency exchanges). The concept of real value rewards merged with the blockchain technology of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> provides an innovative approach to in-game currencies moving towards a unified platform, similar to the standards applied to mobile phone charges, for example.\r\n\r\nThis approach keeps the digital currency completely independent from any bank, central authority, government or corporation but at the same time allowing them all to collaborate and submit proposals, open source code, documentation and content that benefits other participants and parties in the network.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Experience Points team wants to take this model and superimpose it on to real life interactions and transactions.  Basically, consumers and community members can be rewarded in XP for interacting with a service or entity that has adopted the Experience Points platform, such as attending a concert or buying a meal at a restaurant that uses XP.  Users can then spend their XP at participating locations, allowing them to take the experience they’ve gain and put it back into the XP-based economy.\r\n\r\nIn its current stage of development, Experience Points is more geared towards online gaming platforms and services.  Its upcoming development kit will make it easier for developers to integrate the coin into their games for in-game rewards and purchases, as well as giving users a coin to develop a player-driven economy.\r\n\r\nAdopting this token for gaming purposes is one thing, but seeing XP in real world use is another.  A cool concept? Maybe, even if a little bit quirky.  Quixotic to think that the concept will become a reality? Potentially, but it all depends on whether or not some retailers, businesses, and industries see value in using a model like XP to incentivize business.  If they do, and a few get the ball rolling, who knows how far it will go (and who/what it will pick up along the way).","Xpet Coin":"Valuable pet strategy battle game.","X-power Chain":"At present, online traffic tends to be saturated, but the value of offline traffic portals becomes prominent, and the value of a large number of offline scenarios is to be tapped.

Compared to XRP, XHD has the following advantages:\r\n\r\n-The consensus algorithm is more decentralized. In the XHD network trusts, every miner has the right to participate and they can make their own decision. XHD trusts trillions of XHD nodes. Therefore, miners jointly determine the authenticity of the transaction.\r\n-The XHD network is safer and more reliable. In the future, the XHD network will have hundreds of billions of hard disk physical devices to maintain the security of the entire network, and because of the characteristics of the POC consensus algorithm, the probability of a 51% attack on the XHD network is extremely low.\r\n-Fairer, everyone can participate. Since XHD is produced through hard disk mining and there is no monopoly, everyone can participate in the mining, packaging, and distribution of XHD, and the hard disk device is inherently resistant to ASIC. The value of decentralization and credibility has been optimized with a lighter, economical and environmentally friendly blockchain spirit,  which provides more for the vision of “all-mining” Possibilities.\r\n-Ecological diversity, multi-chain coexistence. Because of the POC consensus mechanism, the future XHD backbone can derive more symbiotic sub-chains. XHD can make cross-chain transfers between the main chain and the sub-chains.

Zcash payments are published on a public blockchain, but the sender, recipient, and amount of a transaction remain private.\r\n\r\nZcash is based on peer-reviewed cryptographic research, and built by a security-specialized engineering team on an open source platform based on Bitcoin Core's battle-tested codebase. Our improvement over <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> is the addition of privacy. Zcash uses advanced cryptographic techniques, namely zero-knowledge proofs, to guarantee the validity of transactions without revealing additional information about them.\r\n\r\nHow Zcash works\r\n\r\nZcash encrypts the contents of shielded transactions. Since the payment information is encrypted, the protocol uses a novel cryptographic method to verify their validity.\r\n\r\nZcash uses a zero-knowledge proof construction called a zk-SNARK, developed by our team of experienced cryptographers based on recent breakthroughs in cryptography. These constructions allow the network to maintain a secure ledger of balances without disclosing the parties or amounts involved. Instead of publicly demonstrating spend-authority and transaction values, the transaction metadata is encrypted and zk-SNARKs are used to prove that nobody is cheating or stealing.\r\n\r\nZcash also enables users to send public payments which work similarly to Bitcoin. With the support for both shielded and transparent addresses, users can choose to send Zcash privately or publicly. Zcash payments sent from a shielded address to a transparent address reveal the received balance, while payments from a transparent address to a shielded address protect the receiving value. \r\n\r\nCheck out <a href=\"https://www.coinbureau.com/education/what-is-zcash/\">CoinBureau</a> for guide on What is ZCash.","ZcCoin":"","Zclassic":"Zclassic is a fork of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/zcash\">Zcash</a> founded by Rhett Creighton but with the 20% founders’ reward and slow start removed.

We are using the same parameters which were produced in the now famous secure \"trusted setup meeting\" (source) where Peter Todd participated, and he confirmed to us (source) they are safe to use. If just one of the participants kept their key secret and destroyed it, the whole system is secure.\r\n\r\nZcash is a cryptocurrency run by the Zero Coin Inc. In order to fund their operations, a 20% mining “Founder’s Reward” is included. Every block, in order to maintain consensus, miners running the Zcash code send 20% of their newly mined rewards to an address controlled by the Zero Coin Inc. Because the Zcash source code is open source, Zclassic simply removes the 20% Founder’s Reward. This gives people the option to mine a blockchain using the same technology of Zcash, but without paying the 20% Founder’s Reward.\r\n\r\nThe mission of Zclassic is to stay as similar to Zcash from a technology perspective, but to never take any pre-mine, founder’s-reward or any other kind of fee that goes to a small group of individuals with special permissions whether elected, appointed, or otherwise.","ZCNOX Coin":"A token to exchange for items, buy things locally using zcnox and convert to btc easily using our app our website exchange.","Zcoin":"","ZCore":"ZCore (ZCR) is 100% open source, with PoW (Proof-of-Work) mining based on the NeoScrypt algorithm and maximum supply of 18 million coins.

","ZillionCoin":"ZillionCoin is a PoW coin running on ZillionFLUX algo and supporting the ZillionGrid \"Decentralized Hybrid Blockchain Infrastructure\"","Zilliqa":"Zilliqa (ZIL) is a token developed in the year 2017. Zilliqa is mainly based on the concept of Sharding and primarily aims at improving the scalability of the cryptocurrency networks as in case of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> or <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>. The white paper mentions that the transactions speed would be approximately a thousand times more than that of Ethereum network. Ziliqa is fast, secured and decentralized. Zilliqa’s high throughput means that you can focus on developing your ideas without worrying about network congestion, high transaction fees or security which are the key issues with legacy blockchain platforms.\r\n\r\nZilliqa network uses a concept called Sharding where the transactions are grouped into smaller groups and divided among the miners for the parallel transactional verification. Developing smaller groups for transactional verification means the Consensus can be reached faster and hence a higher number of transactions can be processed in a given time frame. The capacity of the network linearly increases in other cryptocurrencies as the number of people joins the network, but in this case, the capacity is increased at a higher variable rate than the number of members joining the network. By incorporating the Sharding Technology, it can completely revolutionize the smart contract functionality too.\r\n\r\nZiliqa has few pros as it has a great new technology. Zilliqa is the first platform to use sharding technology. This puts it ahead of the rest of the market. It’s a completely new kind of blockchain designed to solve the problem of scalability. Third-generation platforms like Zilliqa could be the big winners in the future of cryptocurrency. Ziliqa has a strong community. The platform has a lot of fans. The Zilliqa ICO only happened because there was so much demand for it. The Zilliqa ICO also shows that the crypto community is ready to see blockchain technology move to the next phase of its development.","ZIMBOCASH":"ZIMBOCASH is a decentralised currency for Zimbabwe.","ZINC":"Zinc simplifies, accelerates and reduces the cost of the hiring journey for workers and recruiters within the technology sector.\r\n\r\nFast decision making\r\nWith a straightforward integration, Zinc simplifies and accelerates the hiring journey.

An itibarıyla <em>BTC_PRICE_DOLLAR</em> dolar üzerinden işlem gören Bitcoin geleneksel bankacılık sisteminin çok güçlü bir rakibi olarak görüldüğü için bazı ülkelerde yasaklanma girişimleri oldu, ancak Blok zincir teknolojisinin doğası gereği Bitcoin ve diğer kripto paraları yasaklamak mümkün değil. Dijital cüzdanı ve internete erişimi olan herkes Bitcoin alıp satabilir. Devletlerin veya bankaların yürüttüğü karşı propaganda çalışmaları Bitcoin’in hızlı yükselişini durduramadı.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\n</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">BTC olarak da bilinen Bitcoin’i değerli kılan şey altındaki teknolojisi. Blok zincir teknolojisi adı verilen bu algoritma, ilk başta merkezi bir kontrol mekanizmasına tabi olmadan iki bilgisayar arasında bilgi alış verişinin hem herkese açık hem de güvenli ve inkar edilemez bir şekilde yapılması problemini çözdü. Dünyanın herhangi bir yerindeki iki bilgisayar birbirlerine bir bilgiyi gönderirken bunun işlem kaydını Bitcoin networküne dahil olan bilgisayarlar arasında dağıtık bir şekilde tutan dijital bir muhasebe defteri geliştirildi. Bu defter herkese açık olduğu için insanların güvenini kazandı ancak onu asıl değerli kılan şey kimsenin defterdeki bilgileri değiştiremeyecek olmasıydı. İşte kişiler arasındaki bilgi transferini mümkün kılan her bir parçaya token dendi. Blok zincir teknolojisinin DNA’sını oluşturan her bir token o kadar kıymetliydi ki bundan dijital bir para ortaya çıkarmak zor olmadı.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\n</p><h3 class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Bitcoin İle Nasıl Alışveriş yapılır?</strong></h3><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\nBitcoin ile yapılan ilk alış veriş 2010 Mayıs ayında gerçekleşti. O zamanlarda 10 bin Bitcoin 41 dolara tekabül ediyordu. Laszlo Hanyecz adlı bir adam Papa John’s’un bir mağazasından iki adet pizzayı 10 bin Bitcoin ödeyerek satın aldı. An itibarıyla 1 Bitcoin BTC_PRICE_DOLLAR, gerisini siz hesaplayabilirsiniz.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\nBitcoin ile alışveriş yapmak için karşınızdaki firmanın Bitcoin ile ödemeyi kabul etmesi gerekir. Bunun için firmanın bir Bitcoin cüzdanının olması ve sizin de sipariş ücretini bu cüzdana transfer etmeniz gerekir. Bitcoin’in patronları anlaşmalı oldukları firmaların sayısını artırmak için durmadan çalışıyor. Starbucks, Virgin Galatic ve Tesla gibi büyük firmalar da dahil olmak üzere birçok firma artık Bitcoin ile sipariş kabul etmeye başladı.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\n</p><h3 class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Bitcoin’in Yaratıcısı Kim?</strong></h3><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\nSatoshi Nakamoto kod adlı kişinin kimliği hala bir sır. 2009 yılında tedavüle girdiğinden beri Bitcoin gündemden hiç düşmedi ancak bu kodu geliştiren, protokolü yazan kişinin kimliği bir sır olarak kaldı. 2016 Mayıs ayında Avustralyalı yatırımcı Craig Wright bu sır perdesini fırsata dönüştürmeyi başardı. Kendisinin Bitcoin’in yaratıcısı olduğunu iddia eden Wright ortağı ile birlikte Bitcoin Cash adlı türevin reklamını yaparak birçok kişiyi dolandırdı. Yatırımcılar para kaybetti ancak Wright bu olaydan karlı çıktı.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\nBazılarına göre Bitcoin, Samsung, Toshiba, Makamichi ve Motorola’nın ortak ürünü. Satoshi, Samsung ve Toshiba’nın kısaltması, Nakamoto ise Nakamichi ve Motorola’nın birleşiminden oluşan bir kısaltmadır iddiası en popüler teorilerden biri olsa da bunu ispatlayan bir delil henüz bulunamadı.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\nBitcoin’in arkasındaki isimlerin gizli olması bunun bir Ponzi Oyunu olduğuna dair şüpheleri doğrulamaya devam etse de BTC’nin yükselişi hala devam etmektedir. </p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\n</p><h3 class=\"ql-align-justify\">Bitcoin’in İzi Sürülebilir mi?</h3><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\nBitcoin ile işlem yapmak isteyen herkesin 1GX5Vwe5LCfdkQ9V2oDSQsZk9kp2vBxvLK gibi uzun bir halka açık adres bilgisine sahip olması gerekmektedir. Bu adres Bitcoin ile işlem yaptığınızda blok zincir kayıtlarına yansımaktadır. Bu adresin gerçek kişi olarak size ait olduğunun bulunması halinde Bitcoin ile yaptığınız işlemlere erişmek mümkün. Zaten halka açık bir muhasebe defteri olarak çalışan blok zincir teknolojisinin en güçlü yanı da bu.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\nDolayısıyla Bitcoin’lerin izinin sürülmesi imkansız değil ancak zordur. Dijital cüzdanlarınının saklandığı flash bellek ya da bilgisayar disklerininizin ele geçirilmesi durumunda yukarıdaki anlamsız harf ve rakamlardan oluşan adres bilgisi sizi ele verecektir.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\n</p><h3 class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Bitcoin Çalınabilir mi?</strong></h3><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\nEvet. 2013 yılında James Howells adındaki bir bilgi işlem personeli 7500 bitcoin kaybetti. Evinde temizlik yaparken, içinde Bitcoin şifrelerinin de olduğu harddiski atan James, 2010 yılından beri bitcoin madenciliği yaparak elde ettiği 7500 bitcoini de attığından habersizdi. Zavallı adam gazetede Norveçli bir adamın çok ucuzken satın aldığı Bitcoin’lerden bir servet elde ettiğini okuduğunda aklı başına geldi, diski aradı ama bulamadı. An itibarıyla 7500 bitcoin 1.8 milyar liraya tekabül etmektedir.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\nJames Howells bir ilk değil. Bitcoin’in bu kadar yükseleceğini tahmin edemeyip dijital cüzdanlarına sahip çıkmayan birçok kişi aynı dertten muzdarip oldu. Bitcoin rezervlerinin yüzde 25’inin bu sebeple sonsuza kadar kayıp olduğu tahmin ediliyor.\n</p><h3 class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></h3><h3 class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Bitcoin Nasıl Kazanılır?</strong></h3><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\nBitcoin’leri elde etmek için iki yöntem bulunmaktadır. Bunlardan ilki ve en kolayı bir aracı kurum üzerinden Bitcoin satın almaktır. İkincisi ve her geçen gün zorlaşan yöntem ise Bitcoin Madenciliği yapmaktır. </p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\nBitcoin geleneksel para ve altın gibi kağıda basabileceğiniz bir para birimi değil. Bitcoinler madencilik adı verilen ve çok karmaşık bir problem çözme süreci sonunda hediye olarak çıkarılmaktadır. Aşağıda detayları verilen bitcoin madenciliği gün geçtikçe daha az karlı ve neredeyse imkansız bir yönteme dönüştü.\n</p><h3 class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></h3><h3 class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Bitcoin Madenciliği Nedir?</strong></h3><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\nBitcoin madenciliği için ihtiyacınız olan şey bilgisayarınızın işlemci gücü. Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin ağını içinde kıymetli madenlerin bulunduğu bir dağ şeklinde tasarladı. Madenlere ulaşmak için dağı kazmanız gerekmektedir. Dağı kazmak için sallanan kazma darbeleri ne ise bitcoin çıkarmak için bilgisayarınızın çözmesi gereken karmaşık ileri düzey matematik problemleri de o.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\nBilgisayarınızı bu problemleri çözmek ve para kazanmak için Bitcoin ağının emrine açtığınızda performansınız kadar Bitcoin kazanmanız mümkün ancak bitcoinlerin değeri arttıkça ve ağa dahil olan kişilerin sayısı arttıkça bu problemler de daha karmaşık bir hal aldı ve madencilik eskisi kadar karşı bir iş olmaktan çıktı. Bu iş için veri merkezindeki sunucularının artık kapasitesinin tamamını ayıran şirketler var diyelim, gerisini siz anlayın.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\nBitcoin ağındaki işlemci kapasitesi dünyanın en güçlü 5 süper bilgisayarının toplam işlemci kapasitesinin toplamından 300 kat daha fazladır. Bitcoin madenciliği dünya çapındaki işlemcilerin çok çalışmasına ve onları soğutmak için fanların daha fazla çalışmasına ve buna bağlı olarak da atmosfere salınan C02 emisyonunun artmasına sebep olduğundan günümüzde yeşili seven, çevreci kişilerin direnişine hedef olmaktadır.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\n</p><h3 class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Tedavülde Kaç Tane Bitcoin Var?</strong></h3><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\nBitcoinlerin sayısı sınırsız değil. Satoshi Nakamoto bu ağdaki token sayısını maksimum 21 milyon olacak şekilde ayarladı ve bu rakamın yaklaşık 17 milyonu tedavülde. Bunların yaklaşık yüzde 25’inin kayıp olduğu da göz önünde bulundurulduğunda tedavülde yaklaşık 13 milyon bitcoin bulunmaktadır.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\nSon Bitcoin 2140 senesinde çıkarılacak. Bunun ardından yeni Bitcoin madenciliği yapmak mümkün olmayacak. Zaten bunu aşmak ve yeni fırsatlardan da yararlanmak isteyen geliştiriciler çatal ya da türev adı verilen süreçler sayesinde Bitcoin Cash ya da Bitcoin SV gibi türevleri piyasaya sürdü.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\n</p><h3 class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Bitcoin Yasaklanabilir mi?</strong></h3><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\nHem evet hem hayır. Bitcoin’in yasaklanması için belli bir coğrafyadaki tüm İnternet erişiminin kapatılması gerekir. Bu açıdan bakıldığında Bitcoin’i yasaklamak imkansız değil, ancak böyle bir ihtimal görünmüyor.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\nBitcoin doğası gereği herhangi bir merkezi sunucuda çalışan merkezi bir yazılımdan ibaret değil. Dolayısıyla sunucuyu kapatıp yazılımı susturmak gibi yöntemlerle bu teknolojiyi yasaklamak mümkün değil. Bitcoin ağındaki bilgisayarların her biri işlemci ve depolama yükünü paylaştığından birkaç bin tanesinin kendisini ağdan çekmesi dahi Bitcoin ağı için minör bir arıza mesabesinde kalacaktır.\nBitcoin’in nakit akışını kendi kontrolleri dışında değiştirdiği gören Bangladeş, Bolivya, Tayland ve Vietnam gibi bazı ülkeler bu parayı yasaklamaya çalıştı, ancak başarılı olamadı. Bitcoin ile işlem yaptığı tespit edilen vatandaşlara hapis dahil ceza verileceğini açıklayınca bir ölçüde yasak başarılı oldu ancak Avustralya, Rusya, Japonya, Venezuela gibi bir takım ülke bunun yasaklanmasından ziyade düzenlenmesinin daha akıllıca olduğunu değerlendirerek Bitcoin’i resmen tanıdı.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\nAmerika ve Hindistan gibi bazı ülkeler ise Bitcoin’e hala mesafeli yaklaşmaktadır. Amerika’da Facebook’un kendi kripto para birimi olan Libra’yı tedavüle sokacağını açıklaması sonucunda şirkete bir bahaneyle milyarlarca dolar para cezası kesilmesi özellikle Trump yönetiminin merkezi devletin kontrolü dışındaki para akışına karşı olduğunun bir göstergesi. Biden ve sonrakilerin sanal para piyasasına nasıl müdahale edeceği ise henüz belli değil.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\n</p><h3 class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Bitcoin Kazandırır mı?</strong></h3><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\nBitcoin piyasaya ilk sürüldüğünde fiyatı 0.0015 dolar iken yıl sonuna doğru yüzde 20566 değer kazanarak fiyatı 0.31 dolara ulaştı.  Takip eden yıllarda da kazandırmaya devam etti. Sadece 2014 yılında MtGox dolandırıcılığı sonrasında fiyatı 751 dolardan 285 dolara düştü ve yatırımcılara hem para hem de güven kaybettirdi. Bu olayın sebebinin blok zincir teknolojisinin kendisinden ziyade şirketin kendi hatası olduğu fark edilince Bitcoin yükselmeye devam etti. Öyle ki 2018 yılının sonuna doğru fiyatının 100 bin dolar civarına ulaşması bekleniyordu. Öte yandan 2019 Ocak ayında yaşadığı büyük düşüşün ardından yatırımcılar bir kez daha para kaybetti. 2019 yılında ve 2020’de stabil bir şekilde küçük dalgalanmalar yaşayan Bitcoin tekrar yükselmeye başladı. An itibarıyla 1 Bitcoin BTC_PRICE_DOLLAR USD seviyesine ulaştı.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\nBitcoin ve diğer kripto paralar uzun soluklu olarak düşünülmesi gereken yatırım araçları. Özellikle Bitcoin’in fiyatının eriştiği seviyeler göz önünde bulundurulduğunda küçük yatırımcılar için çok akıllı bir seçenek olarak görünmemektedir.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\nKripto para piyasasında fiyatı düşük olmakla birlikte daha güçlü algoritmalar sunan yeni paralar da mevcut. Bunların diğer paralardan farkının ne olduğu, hangi konuda bir yenilik sunduğu ve bu bir çatalsa (fork, türev) hangi paradan neden ayrıldığı gibi bilgiler değerlendirilerek yatırım yapılmasında fayda var.</p>"}
